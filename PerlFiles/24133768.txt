implement bash command cd in perl
<p>I tried to implement a bash command <code>system("cd /home/user")</code> in perl , but I get an error saying </p> <pre><code>Can't exec "cd": No such file or directory at temp.pl </code></pre> <p>Is there a way to change the current working directory to the specified one , and the change remains after the perl script has exited also. </p>
<p>You cannot modify the current working directory of a different process in UNIX, at least not without some serious hackery.</p> <p>This is why <code>cd</code> is a built-in in all shells. It is not an external program (nor can it be implemented as an external program).</p>
<p>No. A process can't change its parent process's current working directory. Shells implement commands like <code>cd</code> as "builtins", meaning they're a function in the shell itself, and not a separate process that gets run.</p> <p>You can change the current directory in perl using <code>chdir($dir)</code>, and that change will be inherited by child processes â€” but it won't be passed along to the parent process.</p>
<p>When you want to change the directory inside your Script, you can use the Perl command <code>chdir('dir')</code></p> <p>Example:</p> <pre><code>chdir($dir); </code></pre> <p>You actually cant modify the directory of the parents process, but you can of the current process</p>
<p><code>cd</code> is not a process, it is a shell builtin command that changes the current working directory for that shell process.</p> <p>So use <code>system("sh -c 'cd /my/dir'")</code>. but here system command itself invoke another shall so still it not change directory.</p> <p>use <a href="http://perldoc.perl.org/functions/chdir.html" rel="nofollow">chdir</a> for that.</p>
<p><code>cd</code> is not a process, it is a <strong>shell builtin command</strong> that changes the current working directory for that shell process. So <strong>system("sh -c 'cd /cat/bat'") would "succeed"</strong>, but still wouldn't change the working directory of your perl process; use <strong>chdir</strong> for that.</p>
