Perl - Reformat a column in Excel
<p>Using some combination of <a href="https://metacpan.org/pod/Win32%3a%3aOLE" rel="nofollow"><code>Win32::OLE</code></a>, <a href="https://metacpan.org/pod/Spreadsheet%3a%3aParseExcel" rel="nofollow"><code>ParseExcel</code></a>, <a href="https://metacpan.org/pod/Spreadsheet%3a%3aWriteExcel" rel="nofollow"><code>WriteExcel</code></a>...I want to be able to change the formatting of all of the cells in a column (or multiple columns, based on a condition) to be a custom date format, such as "yyyy-mm-dd h".</p> <p>I have been able to use <code>Win32::OLE</code> to do a find and replace on an Excel file that I have open, but I am not sure the best way to reformat an entire column of cells. I imagine it will be something along the lines of parsing the file with <code>ParseExcel</code>, and using <code>WriteExcel</code> to overwrite the file after changing the format somehow.</p> <p>Any advice would be greatly appreciated, cheers!</p>
<p>Don't overwrite, copy to a new name (then you can compare, and the process is reversable).</p> <p>You would essentially copy all the cells, modifying only the ones you need to format change.</p> <p><a href="http://search.cpan.org/~jmcnamara/Spreadsheet-WriteExcel-2.40/lib/Spreadsheet/WriteExcel.pm#copy%28%24format%29" rel="nofollow">Excel Format Info - many examples for formatting time</a></p>
