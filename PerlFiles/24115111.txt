How to run a specific test plan
<p>I am setting up my test environment to run tests on file changes, but I don't want to run all the test plans when test cases are changed.</p> <p>How can I run a specific test plan in Perl? For example, I only want to run "test2"?</p> <p>t/test.t</p> <pre><code>use Test::More; ok(1, "test1"); ok(1, "test2"); ... done_testing(); </code></pre>
<p>If I were you I'd do the following:</p> <p>1 - if you might want to separate some test from the others, put it in some other test suite...</p> <pre><code>t/00-always_runs.t t/01-maybe_not_so_often.t </code></pre> <p>2 - if the test you're willing to skip depends on some feature or availability on some object, try using a skip block like in Test::More documentation</p> <pre><code>SKIP: { skip $why, $how_many unless $have_some_feature; ok( foo(), $test_name ); is( foo(42), 23, $test_name ); }; </code></pre> <p>From <a href="https://metacpan.org/pod/Test%3a%3aMore" rel="nofollow">https://metacpan.org/pod/Test::More</a></p> <p>Hope it helps and gets you going! Good luck.</p>
