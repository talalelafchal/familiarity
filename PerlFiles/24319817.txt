Using other languages with Rails?
<p>I'm trying to make a Web site that showcases multiple scripting languages, including Ruby on Rails. If I make the framework of the site in Rails, is there a way to run other languages like PHP on the Rails server, or do I need something like XAMPP?</p>
<p>For example when you want to run <a href="/questions/tagged/perl" class="post-tag" title="show questions tagged &#39;perl&#39;" rel="tag">perl</a>, you could use <a href="http://www.shlomifish.org/microperl-web-repl-v1/repl.html" rel="nofollow"><code>Microperl</code></a>. For <a href="http://phpjs.org/" rel="nofollow"><code>php</code></a>. </p> <p>If this all does not work for you or you want to execute it otherwise, you can create APIs in such languages and let Ruby talk to this APIs.</p>
