regex: Match mutiple ids but not identical
<p>I have the file which would have the entry as </p> <p>33745 Neeraj Kumar 33743: License Web Services 33743 WADL generation issues </p> <p>I want to use regex in such a way that it should not match the same id twice i.e it can match multiples but not identicals IN above case it should say the count of 33745 as 1 and 33743 as 1</p> <p>My current code results as count of 33745 as 1 and 33743 as 2</p> <pre><code>foreach $line (@file_list) { while ($line =~ m/(\d{4,}[,|:])/g ){ @temp = split(/[:|,]/, $1); push @work_items, $temp[0]; } } my %count; map { $count{$_}++ } @work_items; </code></pre>
<p><strong>Unique Matches: Back-Reference in Negative Lookahead</strong></p> <p>To retrieve all unique ids, this is enough:</p> <pre><code>@result = $subject =~ m/(\d+)(?!.*\1)/g; </code></pre> <p><strong>Explanation</strong></p> <ul> <li>The parentheses in <code>(\d+)</code> capture the id to Group 1</li> <li>The negative lookehead <code>(?!.*\1)</code> asserts that it is not possible to match any chars, then the id captured by Group 1</li> </ul> <p><strong>Reference</strong></p> <ul> <li><a href="http://www.regular-expressions.info/lookaround.html" rel="nofollow">Lookahead and Lookbehind Zero-Length Assertions</a></li> <li><a href="http://www.rexegg.com/regex-lookarounds.html" rel="nofollow">Mastering Lookahead and Lookbehind</a></li> </ul>
