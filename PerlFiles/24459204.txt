How can I find any repeated duplication in my file
<p>How can I find if my file has any repeated duplication. ?</p> <p>Many of my vi files have large number of molecular co-ordinates, and sometimes, the software I use duplicates molecular co-ordinates on top of the first one, which goes unnoticed and only when I start using the molecule in simulations, that I get to know that this file had a repeated co-rodinates.</p> <p>Using general grep, i need to test for every line , and see if a pattern is found.</p> <p>Instead, is there a better approach ?</p> <p>Ex: </p> <pre><code>C 8.72073 15.19207 10.44503 C 9.57223 14.02835 10.59743 C 10.54225 13.88199 9.86998 </code></pre> <p>repeats in the file</p>
<p>Use <code>sort</code> and <code>uniq</code> plus <code>sed</code> to clean the output:</p> <p>Example:</p> <pre><code>echo -e 'a\nb\nc\na\nb' a b c a b echo -e 'a\nb\nc\na\nb' | sort | uniq -c 2 a 2 b 1 c echo -e 'a\nb\nc\na\nb' | sort | uniq -c | sed -re '/^\s+1\s+/d; s/^\s+[0-9]+\s+//g' a b </code></pre>
