Perl-Mechanize posting hidden form value
<p>I am attempting to create a perl script to test a web form for me. I am using mechanize for the automation and am having trouble finding documentation on the the field method. I am using the field method to return the value of a hidden form and this is causing my post to fail. The problem is probably a simple oversight but I am curious about <code>$mech-&gt;field('name');</code> as it seems to be returning the hidden form's value for me.</p> <p><code>Using perl v5.16.3</code> (w &amp; w/o warnings)</p> <pre><code>$id = $test-&gt;field('MId'); print $id . " \n"; #This is printing the desired Id , #the post will not succeed as long as $id assigned this way. print "This is where I am attempting to upload the images\n"; my $fileuploadresult; $fileuploadresult = $mech-&gt;post($uploadURL, 'Content_Type' =&gt; "multipart/form-data", 'Content' =&gt; [ 'myFile' =&gt; $file , 'MId' =&gt; $id ] ); print $fileuploadresult-&gt;content() . "\n\n\n"; #If I set $id to something like 'test' it #will work fine. #I am using two agent because there are two POST's going on and they have to be sequential. </code></pre> <p>I was wondering why my submit failed when I grabbed the value of a form. I just changed the 'field' method to 'value' and realized this fixed my problem. Sorry noob question didn't look at the documentation enough. When field returned the value I assumed that was part of its functionality I did not realize it also set the value to null. (Or as far as I can tell that is what its doing)</p>
