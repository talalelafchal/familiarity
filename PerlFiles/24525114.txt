What does this error mean - &quot;No matching CIPHER found&quot;?
<p>Although I'm OK in PERL, this below error is new for me and I'm not exactly aware of why it is occurring. Can some one let me understand why this error occurs and how to fix this?<br> Is this similar to like some Module is missing?</p> <pre><code>No matching cipher found: client 3des-cbc,blowfish-cbc,arcfour server aes128-ctr,aes128-cbc,aes192-ctr,aes192-cbc,aes256-ctr,aes256-cbc at /usr/lib/perl5/site_perl/5.8.8/Net/SSH/Perl/SSH2.pm line 92 </code></pre>
<p>This is a message from the <a href="https://metacpan.org/pod/Net::SSH::Perl::Kex" rel="nofollow"><code>Net::SSH::Perl::Kex</code></a> module. It is generated when the <code>choose_ciph</code> method of a <code>Net::SSH::Perl::Kex</code> object is called. Essentially the client/server dialogue that establishes the parameters of the communication has found no solution that is acceptable to both parties</p> <p>If you show your code and can give details of the server system then we can help further</p>
<p>It means exactly what it says:</p> <blockquote> <p><code>No matching cipher found:</code></p> </blockquote> <p>The SSH server you're connecting to cannot or will not support any of the ciphers that your SSH client knows.</p> <blockquote> <p><code>client 3des-cbc,blowfish-cbc,arcfour</code></p> </blockquote> <p>Your client could use <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Triple_DES" rel="nofollow">3DES</a> or <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blowfish_(cipher)" rel="nofollow">Blowfish</a> in CBC <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Block_cipher_mode_of_operation" rel="nofollow">mode</a>, or the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RC4" rel="nofollow">RC4</a> stream cipher. All of these are fairly old ciphers, although they're still considered secure if used correctly.</p> <blockquote> <p><code>server aes128-ctr,aes128-cbc,aes192-ctr,aes192-cbc,aes256-ctr,aes256-cbc</code></p> </blockquote> <p>The server will only use <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Advanced_Encryption_Standard" rel="nofollow">AES</a> (with any of the three standard key sizes) in CTR or CBC modes. Since your client can't or won't use AES, the server and the client have no ciphers in common. Basically, they don't speak any common language, and so cannot communicate properly.</p> <blockquote> <p><code>at /usr/lib/perl5/site_perl/5.8.8/Net/SSH/Perl/SSH2.pm line 92</code></p> </blockquote> <p>Based on this part of the error message, it seems that you're using the <a href="http://search.cpan.org/dist/Net-SSH-Perl/" rel="nofollow">Net::SSH::Perl</a> module. Alas, according to the <a href="http://search.cpan.org/perldoc?Net::SSH::Perl#BASIC_USAGE" rel="nofollow">documentation</a>, Net::SSH::Perl just plain doesn't support AES, so you're not going to be able to use it to talk to this server (unless AES support is added in some later version, of course). Sorry.</p> <p>In the comments, you say that you're actually using <a href="http://search.cpan.org/perldoc?Net::SFTP" rel="nofollow">Net::SFTP</a>, which is then using Net::SSH::Perl internally. If so, you might want to consider switching to either <a href="http://search.cpan.org/perldoc?Net::SFTP::Foreign" rel="nofollow">Net::SFTP::Foreign</a> (which has a <a href="http://search.cpan.org/perldoc?Net::SFTP::Foreign::Compat" rel="nofollow">compatibility wrapper</a> for Net::SFTP) or <a href="http://search.cpan.org/perldoc?Net::SSH2::SFTP" rel="nofollow">Net::SSH2::SFTP</a>. The downside (if you consider it such) is that neither of these is a pure-Perl module: Net::SFTP::Foreign requires an external <code>ssh</code> command to be installed, while Net::SSH2::SFTP needs the external libssh2 library.</p>
