What will happen if we install modules when we have both Active and strawberry Perl in system?
<p>I need to know what will happen if we install Perl modules using CPAN when both Active &amp; Strawberry Perl existing in same system. I have both of them installed in my windows server.<br> As both of them will be installed in different paths, below are my queries regarding installation of Perl modules:</p> <ol> <li>Which one will get updated by default? Active or Strawberry? or both?</li> <li>Is there a way to install modules specifically to only one of them?</li> <li>Will there be any difference in backend installation process for both?</li> <li>By default which one will be given preference if we write Perl script(Active or Strawberry)?</li> <li>If we install using CPAN, what will be its first preference(Active or Strawberry)?</li> </ol> <p>Detailed information will be much appreciated!!</p>
<p>Whichever perl is first in the <code>$ENV{PATH}</code> will be the one that is installed to.</p> <pre><code>C:\&gt;which perl C:\strawberry\perl\bin/perl.EXE </code></pre> <p>This rule will apply to all of your questions, unless you reorder the path or specify a perl version explicitly.</p> <p>To view the order of your path, just use:</p> <pre><code>C:\&gt;perl -E "say for split /;/, $ENV{PATH}" </code></pre>
<blockquote> <p><em>Which one will get updated by default?</em></p> </blockquote> <p>There's no default. It will install the module for whichever Perl you use to run the installer.</p> <blockquote> <p><em>If we install using CPAN, what will be its first preference(Active or Strawberry)?</em></p> </blockquote> <p>On Windows systems, a wrapper named <code>cpan.bat</code> is created when <code>cpan</code> is installed. It launches <code>cpan</code> using "<code>perl</code>", so the first <code>perl</code> in your <code>PATH</code> will be used.</p> <blockquote> <p><em>Is there a way to install modules specifically to only one of them?</em></p> </blockquote> <p>You make sure to run <code>cpan</code> for the right one by using</p> <pre><code>c:\path\to\desired\bin\perl -MCPAN -e shell </code></pre> <p>Manipulating your <code>PATH</code> to place the desired Perl earlier should also do the trick.</p> <blockquote> <p><em>Will there be any difference in backend installation process for both?</em></p> </blockquote> <p>Installing it for one won't install it for the other, if that's what you're asking.</p> <blockquote> <p><em>By default which one will be given preference if we write Perl script(Active or Strawberry)?</em></p> </blockquote> <p>There's no default. The Perl you specify (in your path, in the file association or on the command line) will be used.</p>
