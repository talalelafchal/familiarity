In perl how to get current directory path of any process?
<p>In Perl, I want to get the current working directory of any process.</p> <p>e.g. We have command "pwdx" in unix which gives current working directory of a process.</p> <p>I want similar "pwdx " in perl.</p> <p>Please let me know any Perl command which gives me current working directory of a process.</p> <p>Note: I am on Windows platform and not in Unix platform.</p> <p>Regards,</p> <p>Amol</p>
<p>You could get the details about a process (along with current working directory) with <code>wmic</code> or <code>handle</code> shell commands, as described in this question: <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/20576834/windows-batch-command-to-determine-working-directory-of-a-process">windows batch command to determine working directory of a process</a></p> <p>Then you could use that command with backticks (``) to get the output and use a regex to get the current working directory.</p> <p>Note: I'm not on windows so I can't test the commands.</p>
