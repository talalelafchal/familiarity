How to build OpenSP for German messages?
<p>I am trying to build OpenSP, setting the output message language as German.</p> <p>I have set the LANG variable in sp-generate.mak file and executed the make file and after which i built OpenSP. The problem is that the messages are still in English. How can I change the language to German?</p> <p>This is the official build instruction: <a href="http://openjade.sourceforge.net/doc/build.htm" rel="nofollow">http://openjade.sourceforge.net/doc/build.htm</a></p> <p>Unfortunately it is not helpful. Has anyone got an idea how to build this in Windows and Linux? Any help would be highly appreciated. </p>
