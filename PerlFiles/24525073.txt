FCGI throws warning
<p>I was trying to implement FASTCGI, from following <strong><a href="http://wiki.dreamhost.com/Perl_FastCGI#Handing_off_request_fulfillment_to_a_fork.28.29ed_child" rel="nofollow">tutorial</a></strong>. Whenever I execute the code, I get following warning:</p> <p><strong>Subroutine FCGI::DESTROY redefined at xyz.fcgi line 30.</strong></p> <p>The statement, that is responsible for throwing the warning:</p> <pre><code>*FCGI::DESTROY = sub {}; </code></pre> <p>Any idea, why it throw warning?</p> <p><em>I do not want to suppress the warning</em>.</p>
<p>Below are the cases which cause <code>Subroutine xyz redefined error</code></p> <p>1: You declared the same subroutine somewhere</p> <p>2: <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/a/3429260/257635">You have a dependency loop</a></p> <p>If it's not from above two cases then restarting the server and adding <code>1;</code> at the end of your module may solve the issue.</p> <p>Also see: <a href="http://www.perlmonks.org/?node_id=890026" rel="nofollow">best way to handle Subroutine redefined warning</a></p>
