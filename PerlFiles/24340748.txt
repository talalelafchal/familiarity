Press button in application using perl
<p>How do I control an application using perl script. Once the application is opened, how can I press a button on the GUI of the application. for eg:- after opening IDM, I want to add a new download. For doing that how do I press the "Add url button"</p> <p>Please help</p>
<p>I have no idea what IDM is, you don't tell us this or what platform you're on.
