Perl giving errors on array reference
<p>Could someone explain how to correctly reference the arrays @names and @numbers. Currently I am getting warnings saying that using @names->[$count] is deprecated. I've looked around and people said to do $names->[$count] however when I do this it says that $names / $numbers does not exist.</p> <pre><code>my $ldap = Lib::Phonebook-&gt;new(); my (@names, @numbers, $count, $name_number_count); @names = $ldap-&gt;list_telephone_account_names(); @numbers = $ldap-&gt;list_telephone_account_numbers(); $name_number_count = @names; $count = 0; for $count (0 .. $name_number_count) { print @names-&gt;[$count] . " -&gt; " . @numbers-&gt;[$count] . "\n"; } </code></pre>
<p><code>@names</code> is an array, so to access an element you would use <code>$names[$index]</code>.</p> <p>Also, iterating from <code>0 .. $name_number_count</code> will take you over the end of the array. You want 0 through "the last element index in @names" which would be <code>@names - 1</code> or <code>$#names</code>. So:</p> <pre><code>for my $count (0 .. $#names) { </code></pre>
