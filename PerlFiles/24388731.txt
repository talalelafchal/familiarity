How to do an LDAP search for a large amount of users?
<p>I am using the AD from Windows 2008R2. Right now I have my own ldap script which does an ldap search and stores all users. The problem is I have a very large amount of users (around 100,000 users). What I want to try is to process users by batches of X amount of users and I was thinking in something like this:</p> <pre><code>while ($count != 0) { for ($i = 1; $i&lt;=$max_users_per_group; $i++) { push (@users, $user); } do_something_with_each_group(); } </code></pre> <p>I just wanted to know if any of you had a better idea or an easier way to do this.</p>
