I'm sending a test email using perl but it comes back with system can't find path specified
<p>I've tried:</p> <pre><code>#!/usr/bin/perl $to = 'abcd@gmail.com'; $from = 'webmaster@yourdomain.com'; $subject = 'Test Email'; $message = 'This is test email sent by Perl Script'; open(MAIL, "|/usr/sbin/sendmail -t"); # Email Header print MAIL "To: $to\n"; print MAIL "From: $from\n"; print MAIL "Subject: $subject\n\n"; # Email Body print MAIL $message; close(MAIL); print "Email Sent Successfully\n" </code></pre> <p>but it comes back with <code>The system cannot find the path specified</code>.</p> <p>I've also tried:</p> <pre><code>#!/usr/bin/perl use MIME::Lite; $to = 'abcd@gmail.com'; $cc = 'efgh@mail.com'; $from = 'webmaster@yourdomain.com'; $subject = 'Test Email'; $message = 'This is test email sent by Perl Script'; $msg = MIME::Lite-&gt;new( From =&gt; $from, To =&gt; $to, Cc =&gt; $cc, Subject =&gt; $subject, Data =&gt; $message ); $msg-&gt;send; print "Email Sent Successfully\n"; </code></pre> <p>but it comes back with <code>SMTP Failed to connect to mail server: No such file or directory at G:\email_test.pl line 18</code></p> <p>How do I fix this/these issues so I can send an email successfully? These seem to be the two common examples to use when sending email using PERL and I can't get them to work.</p>
<p>If you're getting <code>G:\email_test.pl</code>, I am assuming you're using a Windows machine. I see <code>open(MAIL, "|/usr/sbin/sendmail -t");</code> in your program which refers to a program on a Unix/Linux system.</p> <p>In Perl, the <a href="http://perldoc.perl.org/Net/SMTP.html" rel="nofollow">Net::SMTP</a> module comes with almost all Perl distributions. I highly recommend people to use that unless they need to MIME encode mail.</p> <p>The module is pretty simple to use too although admittedly not as simple as other email modules. <code>Net::SMTP</code> assumes you know how SMTP works. Fortunately, the <em>S</em> in <em>SMTP</em> stands for <em>Simple</em>. Of course, the people who called it <em>Simple</em> is the same group that thought Emacs was an intuitive program editor.</p> <pre><code># /usr/bin/env perl use strict; use warnings; use feature qw(say); use constant { SMTP_HOST =&gt; 'mailhost', TO =&gt; 'abcd@gmail.com', FROM =&gt; 'efgh@mail.com', SUBJECT =&gt; 'Test Email', USER =&gt; 'question_guy', PASSWORD =&gt; 'swordfish, }; my $smtp = Net::SMTP-&gt;new( SMTP_HOST ) # This is your SMTP host or die qq(Cannot create Net::SMTP Object); $smtp-&gt;auth( USER, PASSWORD ) # If you have to use authentication or die qq(Can't authenticate into ) . SMTP_HOST; $smtp-&gt;mail( FROM ); $smtp-&gt;to( TO ); my $message = "Subject: " . SUBJECT . "\n" . "To: " . TO . "\n" . 'This is test email sent by Perl Script'; $smtp-&gt;data; $smtp-&gt;datasend( $message ); $smtp-&gt;dataend; $smtp-&gt;quit; </code></pre> <p>This above wasn't tested, but I was typing it from a program I wrote that used <code>Net::SMTP</code>. Take a look at the <code>Net::SMTP</code> documentation and play around with it.</p>
