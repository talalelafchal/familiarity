Can't install module from CPAN
<p>First time using CPAN trying to get module. Why can't i install?</p> <pre><code>cpan[9]&gt; install GD::Graph Running install for module 'GD::Graph' Running make for R/RU/RUZ/GDGraph-1.48.tar.gz Prepending blib/arch and blib/lib of 18 build dirs to PERL5LIB; for 'get' Has already been unwrapped into directory /root/.cpan/build/GDGraph-1.48-LBF9mR Prepending blib/arch and blib/lib of 18 build dirs to PERL5LIB; for 'make' '/usr/bin/perl Makefile.PL INSTALLDIRS=site' returned status 512, won't make Prepending blib/arch and blib/lib of 18 build dirs to PERL5LIB; for 'test' Running make test Make had some problems, won't test Running make install Make had some problems, won't install </code></pre> <p>After manual install i got this:</p> <pre><code>... Installing /usr/local/share/man/man3/Graph::Matrix.3pm !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! ERROR: Can't create '/usr/local/lib64/perl5/auto/Graph' mkdir /usr/local/lib64/perl5: File exists at /usr/share/perl5/ExtUtils/Install.pm line 483 !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! at -e line 1 make: *** [pure_site_install] Error 17 </code></pre>
<p><strong>Another avenue to try is the Perl Package Manager.</strong></p> <ol> <li><p>In windows, you search on Perl and it will list appropriate "programs"...</p></li> <li><p>Select the Perl Package Manager.</p></li> <li><p>Then inside the package manager, I search GD::Graph and it gives four choices. </p></li> <li><p>I installed GDGraph-XY.</p></li> <li><p>Then I did a "use GD::Graph;" inside a .pl and it ran fine.</p></li> </ol>
<p>You're trying to create dir <code>Graph</code> in <code>/usr/local/lib64/perl5/auto</code>, but you don't have permission to do so.</p>
