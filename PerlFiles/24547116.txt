How to split the csv file based on some condition and write to new file?
<p>I hv a file like below, i need to get the Value of title(which occurs multiple times in file] and store it in separate file </p> <pre><code>{"card":{"cardName":"43SCX4","portSignalRates":["43SCX4-L-OTU3","43SCX4-C-TENGIGE","43SCX4-C-OTU2","43SCX4-C-FC8G","43SCX4-C-STM64","43SCX4-C-OC192"],"listOfPort":{"43SCX4-L-OTU3":{"portAid":"43SCX4-L-OTU3","signalType":"OTU3","tabNames":["PortDetails","OTU3e2Details"],"title":"OperationalMode",{"label":"Regen","value":"regen"}],"label":"Regen","value":"regen","checked":"","enabled":"true","selected":""},{"type":"dijit.form.Select","name":"Frequency","title":"Transmit Frequency "}}}} </code></pre> <p>I tried with "awk -F, '{}' sample", i'm able to split,but not able to iterate and put it to another file only "title":"<strong>****</strong>" </p>
<p>Through grep with -oE option.</p> <pre><code>$ grep -oE '\"title\":\"[^"]*"' file "title":"OperationalMode" "title":"Transmit Frequency " </code></pre> <p>If you want to get the value of Title then use a lookbehind,</p> <pre><code>$ grep -oP '(?&lt;=\"title\":\")[^"]*' file OperationalMode Transmit Frequency </code></pre> <p>If you want to save it another file then redirect the output to another file using output redirection <code>&gt;</code> operator. Example <code>grep -oP '(?&lt;=\"title\":\")[^"]*' file &gt; outfile</code></p>
