How to get a defined ${^OPEN}?
<p>What changes are required in this code to get a defined <code>${^OPEN}</code>?</p> <pre><code>#!/usr/bin/env perl use warnings; use strict; use open qw( :std :utf8 ); print ${^OPEN}; </code></pre> <hr> <pre><code>Use of uninitialized value $^OPEN in print at ./perl.pl line 6. </code></pre>
<p>This is quite uneasy way. May be it is better to user more readable Perl.</p> <p><code>:utf8</code> outputs utf-8 charset but does not checks its validity, you should not use this one, except for one liners. Use <code>:encoding(UTF-8)</code> instead.</p> <p>Please refer to this post <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/14566460/how-differs-the-open-pragma-with-different-utf8">How differs the open pragma with different utf8?</a> for more information about different types of utf-8 input/outputs.</p> <p>I even do not know what could possibly be <code>${^OPEN}</code> variable. I advice you not to use it at all, as you should not use magic punctuation.</p> <p>Hope it helps</p>
