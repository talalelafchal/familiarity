How to run Mojolicious app from command line with params?
<p>I have a Mojolicious application. It runs under Starman very well, but I want to run it from <code>command line</code> with parameters.</p> <p>Command</p> <p><code>./myapp get /</code></p> <p>works as well, but</p> <p><code>./myapp get /?param=val</code></p> <p>does not work as there is not any parameter.</p> <p>Can you help me?</p>
<p>This is works.</p> <pre><code># Automatically enables "strict", "warnings", "utf8" and Perl 5.10 features use Mojolicious::Lite; # Route with placeholder get '/' =&gt; sub { my $self = shift; my $param = $self-&gt;param('param') // 'qwerty'; $self-&gt;render(text =&gt; "Hello from $param."); }; # Start the Mojolicious command system app-&gt;start; </code></pre> <p>Use it something like this:</p> <pre><code>perl 1.pl get /?param=111 </code></pre>
