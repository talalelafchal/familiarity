Perl HTTP server message MyWebServer: you can connect to your server at http://localhos t:8080
<p>The Perl <a href="https://metacpan.org/pod/HTTP%3a%3aServer%3a%3aSimple%3a%3aCGI" rel="nofollow"><code>HTTP::Server::Simple::CGI</code></a> sample code prints the following message:</p> <pre><code>Perl HTTP server message MyWebServer: you can connect to your server at http:// localhos t:8080 </code></pre> <p>Does this mean the http server only receive http request from localhost?</p> <p>How can I make it accept http from any host? </p>
<p>By default it binds to all interfaces.</p> <p>However if you want to see if it really is, then you can use netstat.</p> <pre><code>netstat -an | grep -i listen </code></pre> <p>will show you what ports your machine is listening to. You should see something like:</p> <pre><code>tcp4 0 0 *.8080 *.* LISTEN </code></pre> <p>(for all interfaces).</p>
<p>Thanks for the response. Actually the perl http service works for both in-bound and out-bound. There was no filter of (localhost). The problem was the I used a port, which is not http default 80. The port was blocked by my desktop's firewall.</p>
