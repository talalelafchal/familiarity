What do the statistics (usr, sys, cusr, csys, and CPU) outputted by Perl's prove command mean?
<p>I've done quite a bit of Googling but can't find an answer to this question. When you run prove on your tests (<a href="http://perldoc.perl.org/prove.html" rel="nofollow">http://perldoc.perl.org/prove.html</a>), you get some statistics that look like:</p> <pre><code>Files=3, Tests=45, 2 wallclock secs ( 0.03 usr 0.00 sys + 0.50 cusr 0.12 csys = 0.65 CPU) </code></pre> <p>What do the numbers given for usr, sys, cusr, csys and CPU mean?</p>
<p>Wallclock seconds is the actual elapsed time, as if you looked at your watch to time it.</p> <p>The usr seconds in the time actually spent on the CPU, in user space.</p> <p>The sys seconds is the time actually spent on the CPU, in kernel space.</p> <p>The CPU time is the total time spent on the CPU.</p> <p>I don't know what cusr and csys represents, I guess they mean children_user and children_system?</p>
