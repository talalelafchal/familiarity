Perl PP/PAR packaged executable can't send XML-RPC requests
<p>I have a perl application that sends a XMLRPC request to a server, and in return, expects a token generated by the server. The problem lies in that the application behaves differently when it was still a perl program (.pl) VS. after it was converted to an executable (.exe)</p> <p>Here is where the problem is, the perl app <code>xmlrpc_test.pl</code> sends my login info as follows</p> <pre><code>use XML::RPC; .... my $server = "https://...."; my $xmlrpc = XML::RPC-&gt;new($server); my $user = "userid"; my $password = "password"; my @args = ($user, $password); my $token = $xmlrpc-&gt;call("login", \@args); .... </code></pre> <p>And if I were to run this perl app directly, I get a token without a problem.</p> <p>But if after I tried packing it with PP (i'm calling wxpar here, but it's the same as pp):</p> <pre><code>wxpar -M XML::TreePP -M LWP::UserAgent -M HTTP::Lite -o xmlrpc_test.exe xmlrpc_test.pl </code></pre> <p>From commandline I get the following output:</p> <pre><code>no data at XML/RPC.pm line 255 </code></pre> <p>And the .exe exits/crashes.</p> <p>From what I find out, XML::RPC call function returned a null in the $response variable, which is what caused the error.</p> <p>Did I miss including a package via the -M fields? The PP ran without any problems and the .exe was successfully generated. Everything runs well except when it comes to send the XMLRPC request... The most puzzling is why it works in .pl form and not in .exe form...</p> <p>Any help is appreciated!</p>
