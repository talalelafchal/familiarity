Provision of switching Devel::Cover on/off
<p>While using Devel::Cover in a test code which tests CodeA, does Devel::Cover have an option of switching the coverage off. Is there a way to switch the coverage module on or off as per user? </p> <p>Test code tests CodeA. Devel::Cover commands are embedded in Test code whenever CodeA commands get tested. </p> <p>Does Devel::Cover include any provision where this coverage collection can be switched on or off? </p>
<p>There is a way to turn coverage on and off at runtime, but it seems that I have forgotten to document it. However, it is tested, so you can see how to use it there:</p> <p><a href="https://github.com/pjcj/Devel--Cover/blob/master/t/internal/criteria.t" rel="nofollow">https://github.com/pjcj/Devel--Cover/blob/master/t/internal/criteria.t</a></p> <p>This isn't exactly the same as if Devel::Cover had never been loaded, but rather it just stops Devel::Cover collecting coverage information for the criteria which are turned off.</p>
