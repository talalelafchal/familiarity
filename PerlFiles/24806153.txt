Reading Perl error
<p>I havent been able to find a decent answer to this question: How to read (interpret) Perl errors. I have the following error</p> <blockquote> <p>can't load /auto/DBD/Oracle/Oracle.so for module DBD::Oracle libclntsh.so.10.1: cannot open shared object file: No such file or directory at packages/perl/perl-5.8.8/lib/5.8.8/i686-linux-thread-multi/somefile.pm line #</p> </blockquote> <ol> <li><p>What I would like to know is how do I understand what the error is saying? I understand that there is an Oracle installation at the auto/DBD/Oracle directory and perl cant load the DBD::Oracle module but what does the first ':' mean in the second line of the error? Is it two errors that I am reading? If not what is the relation of the first line and the second and third lines of the same error?</p></li> <li><p>I have found the path to the Oracle module and can confirm that there is indeed an Oracle.so file. I have confirmed that the environment variable LD_LIBRARY_PATH correctly leads to the Oracle installation. So why am I getting this error? </p></li> </ol>
<pre><code> can't load /auto/DBD/Oracle/Oracle.so for module DBD::Oracle libclntsh.so.10.1: cannot open shared object file No such file or directory at packages/perl/perl-5.8.8/lib/5.8.8/i686-linux-thread-multi/somefile.pm </code></pre> <p>This says that it was trying to load the DBD::Oracle runtime library, and in the process tried to load libclntsh.so.10.1 which it could not open, because it isn;t in the expected directory.</p> <p>if you have <code>locate</code> on your machine you can run $ locate libclntsh.so.10.1</p> <p>and see what you get back. If you get an error, you can try find:</p> <pre><code>$ sudo find / -name libclntsh.so.10.1 -print | less </code></pre>
