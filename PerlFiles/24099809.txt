not got exiftool syntax( pretty basic)
<p>I am trying to learn perl because it does arrays and I want to manipulate some images. I'm not quite sure exactly what an object is. In the explanations about Image::ExifTool it says that the example syntax can be used to get information from an open file. Presumably this means a file in memory with a token (is that the correct expression)? pointing to the bits of memory ? What is the syntax in perl to open a file so that I can get the keys from it ? cheers</p>
<p>Since <a href="https://metacpan.org/pod/release/EXIFTOOL/Image-ExifTool-9.60/lib/Image/ExifTool.pod" rel="nofollow"><code>Image::ExifTool</code></a> refers to open file handle,</p> <pre><code>open my $fh, "&lt;:raw", "picture.jpg" or die $!; # ... # return information about an open image file (object-oriented) my $info = $exifTool-&gt;ImageInfo($fh); </code></pre>
