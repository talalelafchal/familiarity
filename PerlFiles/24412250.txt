Cron job to run on every LAST Friday of every month
<p>I would like an option/option or if there is a better solution from what I am going to present here to get this task accomplished:</p> <p>My first option is this, but it seems complex:</p> <pre><code># This run on every last Friday (or whatever weekday) of the month at 1AM 0 1 * * 5 [ $(date +"\%m") -ne $(date -d 7days +"\%m") ] code.pl </code></pre> <p>Or a more explicit way, every last Friday of every month at 1AM:</p> <pre><code>0 1 25-31 1,3,5,7,8,10,12 5 code.pl 0 1 24-30 4,6,9,11 5 code.pl 0 1 22-28 2 5 code.pl </code></pre> <p>Thanks for looking and suggestions! </p>
