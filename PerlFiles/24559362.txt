Any easy way to fill a readonly form (jQuery datepicker) with WWW::Mechanize?
<p>I'm trying to write a script that a branch library can use to automatically register summer camp students in their summer reading program. I have everything working with WWW::Mechanize except a single form which has the readonly attribute </p> <pre class="lang-html prettyprint-override"><code>&lt;input name="form_readtime_date" id="form_readtime_date" type="text" readonly="true" /&gt; </code></pre> <p>The form is filled in by a jQuery Datepicker</p> <pre class="lang-js prettyprint-override"><code>/* create datepicker */ jQuery(document).ready(function() { jQuery('#form_readtime_date').datepicker({ dateFormat: 'yy-m-d', numberOfMonths: 3, //altFormat: "yymmdd", //dateFormat: 'DD, MM, d, yy', //minDate: '0d', //maxDate: '+2yy', //minDate: new Date(), //maxDate: new Date(), //onSelect: setFocus('#form_readtime_date'); minDate: new Date(2014,5,18), maxDate: new Date(2014,6,2), //constrainInput: true, beforeShowDay: nationalDays }); //$("#form_readtime_date").attr( 'readOnly' , 'true' ); }); </code></pre> <p>Is there any way I can just ignore the fact that this is normally filled in by the datepicker, and fill the form using mechanize? Right now running</p> <pre><code>$login_form = $mech-&gt;form_number(2); ... #Set some other fields local $^W = 0; $mech-&gt;field("form_readtime_date",$date,1); $mech-&gt;click_button(value=&gt;"Add Reading Time"); </code></pre> <p>Does not throw any errors, but doesn't appear to submit the form.</p> <p>I know that Mechanize can't handle Javascript, but it seems like that shouldn't matter here as the end result of the script running is jut to change the value of a HTML form. Shouldn't I be able to tell Mechanize to ignore the "readonly" attribute, change the value, and submit the form? Apparently the Python version of mechanize <a href="http://wwwsearch.sourceforge.net/mechanize/faq.html" rel="nofollow">lets you do this</a>. The result sent back to the server would be the same in any case. (The no warnings doesn't make a difference, I stuck it in because <a href="http://www.perlmonks.org/?node=664303" rel="nofollow">some thread</a> suggested it).</p> <p>I realize that I could probably use WWW::Mechanize::Firefox (or something else) to do this, but I've had a hard time installing it, and it seems like I should be able to do this with Mechanize. Thanks for any help you can provide. </p> <p><strong>Update, it turns out that Mechanize is happy to change the value of readonly fields, and this error was due to something else in my code.</strong></p>
