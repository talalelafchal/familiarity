Perl identifying md5 hash and printing it
<p>I have problem with my simple perl script: </p> <pre><code>open IN, "&lt;file1.txt" or die print "can't open file!"; while($line = &lt;IN&gt;){ $line =~ /[a-z0-9]{32}/i; my $substr = $1; print $substr; } </code></pre> <p>it has to identify md5 hashes in file, one per line, and print it, but it is not working properly, it prints me nothing, or if I modify something it gives me output</p> <pre><code>11111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111 </code></pre> <p>I have no clue what's wrong with it.</p>
<p>You aren't capturing anything using parenthesis.</p> <p>Also, it is wise to check to see if a regex actually matches before trying to use the captured groups.</p> <pre><code>if ($line =~ /([a-z0-9]{32})/i) { print $1, "\n"; } </code></pre>
