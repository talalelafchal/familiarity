Solid Lines with Different colors using Gnuplot in Perl
<p>I am trying to create a chart with two conditions :-</p> <pre><code>1) Solid lines 2) Different colors . </code></pre> <p>Here is my code snippet :- </p> <pre><code>my $set = Chart::Gnuplot::DataSet-&gt;new( xdata =&gt; "words", ydata =&gt; "bits", title =&gt; "wordsvsbits", type =&gt; "matrix", font =&gt; "arial, 20", width =&gt; 7, style =&gt; "linespoints", linetype =&gt; "solid", imagesize =&gt; "1.5,1.5", ); </code></pre> <p>When i do this , I get solid lines with only one colour . If I dont give linetype , 1st line is a solid (Red color), 2nd line is dashed with different color and 3rd line is also dashed with a new color . Here I want to get new color for each line , but they should all be solid lines . Kindly , please help me .</p>
<p>Until version 4.6. this is controlled by <code>set termoption solid</code>. In Perl this should work with </p> <pre><code>my $chart = Chart::Gnuplot-&gt;new( termoption =&gt; "solid", ); </code></pre> <p>and without specifying the <code>linetype</code>.</p>
