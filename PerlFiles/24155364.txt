Perl regex to match backslash at end of the string
<pre><code>$str = '\good\day'; $str =~ s#\\#\\\\#g; print $str; </code></pre> <p>Result is : \\good\\day</p> <p>When </p> <pre><code>my $str = '\good\day\'; </code></pre> <p>I would like to get the result \\good\\day\\</p> <p>Regex <code>$str =~ s#\\#\\\\#g;</code> doesn't give the expected result.</p> <p>Can you please help me?</p>
<p>Your code shouldn't even compile. It should give the error:</p> <pre><code>Can't find string terminator "'" anywhere before EOF </code></pre> <p>You need to escape the second backslash in your single quoted string declaration. Just like you have to escape a single quote with a backslash, you also need to escape backslashes at the end of a single quoted string.</p> <p>This code will work as you intend:</p> <pre><code>my $str = '\good\day\\'; print "From: ", $str, "\n"; $str =~ s#\\#\\\\#g; print " To: ", $str, "\n"; </code></pre> <p>Outputs:</p> <pre><code>From: \good\day\ To: \\good\\day\\ </code></pre>
