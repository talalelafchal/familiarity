Subtracting a Minute in Perl
<p>I have a variable in Perl that I initialized as <code>$invoice_date = '1/6/14'</code> (June 1st 2014). How can I determine the datatype that Perl considers this variable to be? </p> <p>I'd like to subtract a minute from the invoice date to get May 31 2014 11:59PM. How can I do this with or without declaring $invoice_date to be a certain datatype?</p> <p>Update: Thanks for the comments and answers. Since it is a string, I am going to try to concatenate the time portion. I have a another variable $period_end_date which is set to May 31, 2014. I'm going to try to concatenate the 11:59PM to it. </p> <p>The string is subsequently sent in a SQL statement. If I can figure out what SQL expects for the string, it should be possible to insert the time portion. </p>
<p>You need some date manipulation module as <code>'1/6/14'</code> is plain string, and two digit years were abandoned prior to <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Year_2000_problem" rel="nofollow">Y2K</a> event.</p> <pre><code>use Time::Piece; use Time::Seconds; my $t = Time::Piece-&gt;strptime("1/6/2014", "%d/%m/%Y"); $t -= ONE_MINUTE; print $t; </code></pre> <p>output</p> <pre><code>Sat May 31 23:59:00 2014 </code></pre>
