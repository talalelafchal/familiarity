Curl thowing error while trying to query JIRA with strings in field filter
<p>I need some help with my perl script.</p> <p>I am new to perl and using curl and despite a lot of searching/ trial and error I am still stumped.</p> <p>I am trying to use CURL to retrieve a set of jira issues based on the provided JQL. </p> <p>Unfortunately I am having issues with spaces when I search fields like summary:</p> <pre><code>my $jql = JiraUrl.'search?jql=summary~"Some%20Silly%20Issue"'; </code></pre> <p>When I curl this...</p> <pre><code>my $jsonResponse = `curl -D- -u $user:$password -X GET -H "Content-Type: application/json" $jql`; </code></pre> <p>I get an error ..</p> <pre><code>{"errorMessages":["Error in the JQL Query: Expecting either \'OR\' or \'AND\' but got \'Silly\'. (line 1, character 77)"],"errors":{}}'; </code></pre> <p>Basicly when I escape the " " with %20 it ignores the "'s </p> <p>Any help for how to get around this? </p>
<p>It looks like it's a shell escaping issue. The quotes are being interpreted by the shell. Try this:</p> <pre><code>my $jsonResponse = `curl -D- -u $user:$password -X GET -H "Content-Type: application/json" '$jql'`; </code></pre>
