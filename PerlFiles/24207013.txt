Perl Mechanize: No output, No error
<p>I was using the below code to scrape the page after login. It was working fine few weeks back. But, Now it is dying at line 14 without throwing any errors.I don't know what went wrong</p> <pre><code> use WWW::Mechanize; use HTTP::Cookies; my $url = "http://smshub.mobiledigiconverse.net/MDC_CI/loginpage"; my $username = "username"; my $password = "password"; my $useragent = "Mozilla/5.0 (X11; Ubuntu; Linux x86_64; rv:30.0) Gecko/20100101 Firefox/30.0"; my $mech = WWW::Mechanize-&gt;new( agent =&gt; $useragent); my $cookie=$mech-&gt;cookie_jar(HTTP::Cookies-&gt;new()); $mech-&gt;get($url); my $cont1 = $mech-&gt;content(); $mech-&gt;form_name('login-form') or die; $mech-&gt;field( uname =&gt; $username ) or die; $mech-&gt;field( pwd =&gt; $password ) or die; $mech-&gt;submit('Login') or die; my $cont = $mech-&gt;content(); print $cont; </code></pre> <p>When the die statements are removed, same page content is obtained. I suppose someone would have experienced the same errors. Hoping to find a solution</p>
