concatenation is not working as expected in perl
<p>Here is a simple piece of code in perl. Here I can print the value of the key, however I am never able to concatenate $key with $value. Whenever I try to do it the value of $key is not concatenated.Only the $value part gets printed.Can someone please help. This doesnt work with join either.</p> <pre><code>while(my ($key, $value) = each(%symbol_map)) { print $key."\n"; print $key.$value."\n"; print $DATA_OUT $key." ".$value . "\n"; } </code></pre>
<p>Are you sure that your hash is properly defined?</p> <p>Try inserting <code>%ENV</code> instead of <code>%symbol_map</code> to see if it will then list your environment correctly. It does so for me.</p> <p>I am guessing that your symbol table contains:</p> <pre><code>("" =&gt; "HB1 HKFD HKFE 130 830 HKFD") </code></pre> <p>instead of:</p> <pre><code>("134173" =&gt; "HB1 HKFD HKFE 130 830 HKFD") </code></pre>
