Perl Substitute String in Text File
<p>I'm working with Strawberry Perl on windows and am running into a problem substituting strings in a text file. This is an example of the data in the file:</p> <pre><code>&gt;CR:8A 55 CT:98 2 *CT:87 1 CR:98 88 CT:99 0 CT:80 80 +CT:87 5 </code></pre> <p>I'm trying to replace for example: CR with Testing_Sub and 80 with NormalTest. So far I can't understand why what I have does not work for me:</p> <pre><code> print "Enter filename (include .txt):"; chomp($fname = &lt;STDIN&gt;); # save file name in variable $fname # Open a file. If unsuccessful, print an error message and quit. open (FPTR,$fname) || die "Can't Open File: $fname.txt\n"; @filestuff = &lt;FPTR&gt;; #Read the file into an array print "The number of lines in this file: ",$#filestuff + 1,"\n"; #print @filestuff; open FILE, "+&gt;&gt;", $workfile or die $!; @filestuf = $workfile; #Read the file into an array print "The number of lines in this file: ",$#filestuf + 1,"\n"; $line =~ s/^A_B_([^C])/X_Y_$1/; </code></pre> <p>This immediately closes the Perl Terminal. I've tried something like this:</p> <pre><code>my $t =~ s/^\.\///; </code></pre> <p>to see if I could get ./test to be replaced with test in my file and that hasn't worked either.</p> <p>Any suggestions? Am I not understanding something important about Perl?</p> <p>Any helpful hints would be great.</p> <p>DM</p> <p><strong>Edit</strong></p> <p>The reason <code>use strict</code> and <code>use warnings</code> weren't working is because I was trying to execute the perl program directly from a file instead of the command line. The errors I now receive are:</p> <p>-"my" variable $workfile masks earlier declaration in same scope</p> <p>-Global symbol "$fname" requires explicit package name.</p>
