Concatenate Variable in Perl
<p>Below is my code. Supposedly I wanted to concatenate the variable $process with the text "processes running".</p> <pre><code>my $process =`ps aux | grep '[c]pu2006' -c `; my $process2= "$process" . " processes running\n"; print $process2; </code></pre> <p>I want the output to be:</p> <pre><code>3 processes running </code></pre> <p>But it turned out to be:</p> <pre><code>3 processes running </code></pre> <p>Can someone help me with this code?</p>
<p>Your $process variable contains a number 3 and a line feed.</p> <p>You can remove the linefeed with chop or chomp.</p> <p>So your script becomes:</p> <pre><code>my `$process =ps aux | grep '[c]pu2006' -c`; chomp($process); my $process2= "$process" . " processes running\n"; print $process2; </code></pre> <p>chop and chomp are a bit confusing...</p> <p>If you are using unix you can use chop because unix uses only '\n' as a line separator.</p> <p>If you are using windows you can use chomp because chomp is smart enough to know what the input line separator is and will remove two characters \r and \n.</p> <p>Best practice is to use chomp.</p> <p>If you want to clean it up a bit you could also say:</p> <pre><code>chomp (my $process =`ps aux | grep '[c]pu2006' -c`); print "$process processes running\n"; </code></pre>
