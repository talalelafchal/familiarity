website hacked possible perl script on router?
<p>I dont know if this will be the right place to ask, and I dont know exactly how to phrase this in a way that will make sense. Im looking at a website for a customer in work and I am connected to the wifi I can see random references to Viagra thrown in between sentences on their website. They cant see it when they look from their own computers and I cant see it if Im using 3G on my phone but when I connect to the wifi I can see it then. I was told it could be perl script on their router so I wouldnt see anything suspicious in the source code. how can something like this be done?</p>
<p>It is possible to create a transparent proxy which can alter the content of any request or response passing through it. Your question is incredibly vague, so I cannot provide much specific help, however you can read about <a href="https://duckduckgo.com/?q=squid%20http%20proxy%20transparent" rel="nofollow">squid</a> (link is to a search heh) which is a http proxy which can perform such tasks.</p> <p>One of the first things I would look at would be the <a href="http://www.netfilter.org/" rel="nofollow">iptables</a> for the router. It may be that external requests are being routed through such a proxy while internal ones are not.</p>
