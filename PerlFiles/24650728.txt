&quot;EPIC requires a Perl interpreter&quot; in Eclipse Kepler
<p>I have installed Eclipse Kepler and EPIC, the Java Development Kit, and ActivePerl.</p> <p>When I create a Perl script and try to run it as Perl local I get the error </p> <pre><code>To operate correctly, EPIC requires a Perl interpreter </code></pre> <p>I don't understand why that is. Am I going wrong because I have installed Active Perl? Why is it that my Perl interpreter is not detected by EPIC?</p> <p>I installed EPIC from <a href="http://www.epic-ide.org/updates/testing/" rel="nofollow">the betas here</a>. I went to <code>Help/Install new software/Add</code> then I entered this link and followed the instructions. Then my Eclipse also restarted</p> <p>I am still unable to run a Perl script because of the above error.</p>
<p>Make sure you have the <code>perl</code> interpreter in your PATH environment (ie when you issue a <code>perl</code> command from the cmd prompt, it will be found)</p>
<p>You need to specify the Perl executable's <em>absolute path</em> in EPIC configuration under Eclipse. Here are are the steps</p> <pre class="lang-none prettyprint-override"><code>Eclipse -&gt; Window (on menu) -&gt; Preferences -&gt; PerlEPIC -&gt; Perl Executable (on hte right hand side pane) -&gt; /usr/bin/perl (this is my perl binary on ubuntu Linux) </code></pre> <p>The <code>/usr/bin/perl</code> part is important; that's my Perl executable.</p> <p><strong>Note:</strong> The above steps were taken from my Eclipse running on Linux, but I hope you get the idea</p>
