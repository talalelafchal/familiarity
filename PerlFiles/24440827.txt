Perl regex output hyphens multiple &quot;words&quot;
<p>When I have a string with multiple hyphens in it, I seem to be able to find the (only) desired value, but why are there multiple outputs? I'd like to just report the matched string entirely, with hyphens. I've included what the output probably is, along with a way to rebuild the string, but this method seems like unnecessary work. </p> <pre><code>my $string = "phonenumber123-456-7890"; my @secondStrings = $string =~ m/(\d+)-(\d+)-(\d+)/g; foreach (@secondStrings){ print $_, "\n"; } if ($string =~ m/(\d+)-(\d+)-(\d+)/g){ print $1."-".$2."-".$3, "\n"; } </code></pre>
<p>I believe you just want to put the entire phone number (123-456-7890) into 1 capture group, right now you are using 3.</p> <pre><code>my ($number) = $string =~ m/(\d+-\d+-\d+)/g; </code></pre> <p>Further reading can be found here: <a href="http://perldoc.perl.org/perlre.html#Capture-groups" rel="nofollow">http://perldoc.perl.org/perlre.html#Capture-groups</a></p>
