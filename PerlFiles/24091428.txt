Using pig to uncompress a .deflate file
<p>I was able to find a perl solution on here, but I wasn't sure how to use that in combination with pig. </p> <p>I have a .deflate file that's practically a json file. It just needs outer "[]" and commas separating the objects ({}). The ultimate goal is to convert that into a file that is just a list of the values, which are all separated by some delineator. I was thinking of using perl to inflate it, python to turn it into a json, then pig to process it into the form needed. Is there a better way that would avoid this? </p> <p>Adding more info: I see. I'll look into that. So the reason I want to work with pig is because the files I'm working with a pretty massive. It seems like just loading it into pig did the trick, but formatting it is still an issue. I'll try learning some pig, and if not, I'll do what you recommended. Thanks! </p>
