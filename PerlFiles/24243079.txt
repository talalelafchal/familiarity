How to get only the first figure of a String in Perl
<p>Consider the following String:</p> <pre><code>AS58536:AS-V6PEERS </code></pre> <p>I just want to get 58536. By now I split the string at : and the remove all nondigits. Is there an option to look for so to say the first occurence of neighboring digits and stop at the first non-digit character? I just am curious for a fancy one liner.</p>
<p>If you want to match the first sequence of digits in a string, then one of these examples might help you:</p> <pre><code> echo "AS58536:AS-V6PEERS" | perl -ne '/(\d+)/ and print $1, $/;' perl -e '$string="AS58536:AS-V6PEERS"; $string =~ s/.*?(\d+).*/$1/; print $string,$/;' </code></pre> <p>I think that's what you mean by </p> <blockquote> <p>the first occurence of neighboring digits and stop at the first non-digit character</p> </blockquote>
