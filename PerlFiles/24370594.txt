Perl Right-Click Menu on STDOUT only works with System Command
<p>I want to right-click and get the standard command-prompt context menu for a Perl script's STDOUT/STDIN. Yet this only works if I've first "connected with the system". Why?</p> <p>This does not have a right-click menu:</p> <pre><code>print 'hello world'; # `dir`; # it *needs* this - commented out doesn't work &lt;STDIN&gt;; # Just to hold the window open </code></pre> <p>Yet this does:</p> <pre><code>print 'hello world'; `dir`; # anything in backticks or system() will work &lt;STDIN&gt;; # Just to hold the window open </code></pre> <h3>Theories for why the Context Menu Doesn't show up</h3> <ul> <li>old version of Perl issue I'm stuck with till I upgrade (if ever)</li> <li>Something weird with not being able to pass in command line arguments because windows doesn't like giving you access to the details for file-types anymore? (yes I know there is a registry fix, but if I fix it on mine I'll need to fix it on about 6 other computers)</li> <li>Some other random issue?</li> </ul> <hr> <h3>Setup</h3> <ul> <li>Windows 7</li> <li>Perl 5.6.0 with no libraries (yea I know - I'm stuck with it)</li> <li>Run using double-click (.pl files set to open with "C:...\perl.exe" "%1" (no command line options))</li> </ul>
