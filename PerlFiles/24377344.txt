Perl emulating linux time command
<p>I am writing a perl script, and I need to achieve the same output as the linux "time" command, but without actually using the "time" command. Meaning I need to get the "real", "usr", "sys" times from a specific start time up to another point in time.</p> <p>I have looked at the <a href="https://metacpan.org/pod/Time%3a%3aHiRes" rel="nofollow"><code>Time::HiRes</code></a> library, but I am new to perl and am not sure how to use it properly.</p> <p>How can I achieve the same output as the "time" command using <code>Time::HiRes</code>?</p>
<p>You can't. The breakdown of user and system time cannot be calculated from the elapsed wall time, which is the only information that Time::HiRes will give you.</p> <p>You will need to use a module like <a href="http://search.cpan.org/~jhi/BSD-Resource/Resource.pm" rel="nofollow">BSD::Resource</a> (specifically, the <code>getrusage()</code> function) to get this information.</p>
