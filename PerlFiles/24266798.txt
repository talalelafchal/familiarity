How to match multiple words with hyphen in perl regexp
<p>I would like to know how to match multiple words (contains space) separated by hyphen in a url using perl regular expressions. For example,</p> <pre><code>url = &amp;name=abc&amp;age=12&amp;address=ab - cd&amp;city=xyz; url = &amp;name=abc&amp;age=12&amp;address=abcd&amp;city=xyz; </code></pre> <p>In the given url, I would like to match the address field alone and replace it with empty.</p> <p>I am trying this but it is not matching the hyphen and the words followed from first url but it is working fine for second url.</p> <pre><code>url =~ s/\&amp;address=(\w+)//g; </code></pre> <p>Any help would be greatly appreciated.</p>
<p>The regular expression is a decent approach, but it has to potential to destroy the integrity of your URLs by potentially removing additional information that might be important (e.g. fragments). </p> <p>An alternative approach would be to use the <a href="https://metacpan.org/pod/URI%3a%3aQueryParam"><code>URI::QueryParam</code></a> module to overwrite the value with nothing:</p> <pre><code>#!/usr/bin/perl use strict; use warnings; use URI; use URI::QueryParam; my $url = 'http://www.domain.com/a/b/c?name=abc&amp;age=12&amp;address=ab - cd&amp;city=xyz'; my $uri = URI-&gt;new($url); $uri-&gt;query_param('address', ''); print "Address is now: " . $uri-&gt;query_param('address') . "\n"; </code></pre>
<p>Try one of these by un-commenting and should work for you , for more help please comment with desired output you want.</p> <pre><code>#!/usr/bin/perl $url = '&amp;name=abc&amp;age=12&amp;address=ab - cd&amp;city=xyz'; $url = '&amp;name=abc&amp;age=12&amp;address=abcd&amp;city=xyz'; $url =~ s/address=(.*)&amp;//g; #$url =~ s/address=(.*)&amp;/$1/g; print $url; </code></pre>
