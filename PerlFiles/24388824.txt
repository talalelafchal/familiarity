Perl - Is this right name for function?
<p>The title say it all. I am trying to find good naming convention for my functions. Some suggestions are <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/979118/trouble-coming-up-with-good-names-for-functions">here</a> but I would like to know your opinion and if it is possible to use shorter name and still preserve the meaning of the function. This is my function:</p> <pre><code>sub convert_AoA_to_HoA_where_hash_key_is_element_from_particular_inner_array_index_and_hash_value_is_reference_to_this_inner_array(){ my ($argv1, $argv2, $argv3) = @_; my @AoA = @$argv1; my $HoA = $argv2; my $index = $argv3; foreach my $array (@AoA){ $HoA-&gt;{"$array-&gt;[$index]"} = $array; } } </code></pre>
<p>If you are having to do this, this may be indicating something about the suitability of the existing data structures to begin with.</p> <p>As <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/a/24389492/133939">mpapec demonstrates</a>, the functionality is simple enough to replicate without the need for a dedicated subroutine using <code>map</code>.</p> <p>Since the keys of the resultant hash are the values of a particular column, an alternative could be to use a hash slice to clarify intent: </p> <pre><code>my %hash; @hash{ map $_-&gt;[$index], @AoA } = @AoA; </code></pre> <p>The only time when I would consider having to roll this into a subroutine would be if I had no control over the incoming data structure and needed to output separate hashes for different indices. Having said that, <code>rehash_by_column_index</code> is a more-befitting name for such a sub.</p>
<p>Without going into philosophical debate, you don't need to make it a function,</p> <pre><code>my %HoA = map { $_-&gt;[$index] =&gt; $_ } @AoA; </code></pre>
