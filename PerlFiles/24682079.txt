Solving Equations in Perl
<p>How should I solve my equations in Perl?</p> <p>I know binary search is one solution (and perhaps pretty fast for my equations) but I would like to know if there is a ready to use solutions such as math packages or libraries so that I can use them instead of implementing my own solver?</p> <p><strong>NOTE:</strong></p> <ul> <li>This is, find <code>x</code> for a given <code>y</code>.</li> <li>The functions are strictly increasing</li> <li>The equations usually look like: <code>y = a + b*sqrt(x) + b*x</code> or <code>y = sqrt(a*(x-b)**2*(x-c)/(x-d))</code></li> <li>Please don't complain that "this is off topic" or "you should ask this in <a href="http://math.stackexchange.com">http://math.stackexchange.com</a>". I want to see this problem from the programming point of view, particularly in <strong>Perl</strong>!</li> </ul>
<p>Have you considered using libraries? There's <a href="http://search.cpan.org/~wimv/Math-LP-0.03/lib/Math/LP.pm" rel="nofollow">Math::LP</a>, for instance.</p> <p>See the <a href="http://www.perlmonks.org/?node_id=284324" rel="nofollow">Perl and Math</a> tutorial from PerlMonks for more info.</p>
<p>Search for symbolic math on MetaCPAN. Lots of interesting looking options. <a href="https://metacpan.org/search?q=symbolic+math" rel="nofollow">https://metacpan.org/search?q=symbolic+math</a></p>
