autoreply program sendmail giving &quot;DSN: Service unavailable&quot; error
<p>I am trying to use an auto reply program for one of the users.</p> <p>It works fine when I have user email address defined in <code>.forward</code> file but it gives following error when I put it in script:</p> <pre><code>Jun 28 12:25:38 localhost sendmail[5210]: s5SJPFkN005208: to="|/home/alpha/autoreply.pl", ctladdr=alpha@localhost (501/501), delay=00:00:10, xdelay=00:00:00, mailer=prog, pri=60446, dsn=5.0.0, stat=Service unavailable Jun 28 12:25:38 localhost sendmail[5210]: s5SJPFkN005208: s5SJPckN005210: DSN: Service unavailable </code></pre> <p>Do I have have make any changes in sendmail configs (i.e. symbolic link etc)?</p> <p>Thanks.</p>
<p>The issue was /etc/smrsh did not have symbolic link for perl which can be defined as</p> <p>ln -s /usr/bin/perl /etc/smrsh/perl</p>
<p>1.Have you checked problems mentioned in sendmail FAQ?<br> <a href="https://www.sendmail.com/sm/open_source/support/support_faq/faq_ver_8_issues/#3.11" rel="nofollow">Sendmail-FAQ-3.11: Why can't my users forward their mail to a program?</a><br> 2. On most linuxes sendmail uses procmail as local mailer program.<br> You may try to execute your script from <code>~/.procmailrc</code> of the user.</p>
