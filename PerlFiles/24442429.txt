Perl: Matching strings by numerical value or
<p>I have a tsv file which contains two columns (called TG and ESP) that have either a numerical value or are null. I want to filter through the file an only keep the rows that either have a value less than 1 or a no value. I have written the following while loop:</p> <pre><code>while (&lt;FILE&gt;) { my $line = $_; chomp $line; my @c = split('\t', $line); my $TG = $c[34]; if ( $TG !~ /\s/ || $TG &gt; 1 ) { next; } my $ESP = $c[39]; if ( $ESP !~ /\s/ || $ESP &gt; 1 ) { next; } print "$line\n"; </code></pre> <p>For some reason, these if statements cause my program to skip every line in the file. I want the if statements to skip only those lines that have a numerical value greater than 1. Any idea what I'm doing wrong? </p>
<p>You're skipping if either of those two fields does not contain a space</p> <pre><code>$TG !~ /\s/ </code></pre> <p>Since there is no such thing as a "<em>null</em>" value in a tsv file, perhaps you just want to check if they're numerical before doing a comparison?</p> <pre><code>next if $TG =~ /\d/ &amp;&amp; $TG &gt; 1; </code></pre>
