Openstreetmap: filter out data that have been edited after some timestamp
<p>I want to get OSM data after some timestamp - in other words the last records after a certain timestamp. I have downloaded the osm file of the area. I went through the osmosis documentation but could not find a way to filter it by time. The result should be same as when we use the timestamp-argument. Well how to do that:</p> <ul> <li>I could use the overpass but the area is large and overpass timed out many times</li> <li>I could use the osmconvert-tool (cf the manual: m.m.i24.cc/osmconvert.c )</li> </ul> <p>Some of the following statements might be useful for the task: </p> <pre><code> "--timestamp=&lt;date_time&gt; add a timestamp to the data\n" "--timestamp=NOW-&lt;seconds&gt; add a timestamp in seconds before now\n" </code></pre> <p>What I have tried is the following; </p> <pre><code>./osmfilter austria-latest.osm --keep="$key=$school" | ./osmconvert - --all-to-nodes --csv="@id @lat @lon @timestamp $key name" --csv-headline | </code></pre> <p>but this fails. How to get the data out of the osm-pbf-file. Should I use the statements drop! or should i name a certain time from timestamp to timestamp!?</p>
<p>You want to process OSM history planet (extracts): <a href="https://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/Planet.osm/full" rel="nofollow">https://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/Planet.osm/full</a></p>
<p>Since version 0.7.50 <a href="http://overpass-api.de" rel="nofollow">Overpass API</a> provides a way to query for data, which changed since a given timestamp or in a given timeframe. It is even possible to restrict the change analysis to certain tags (or filter criteria). Please check the Overpass API Wiki page for more details on "<a href="http://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/Overpass_API/Overpass_QL#Delta_between_two_dates_.28.22diff.22.29" rel="nofollow">diff</a>" and "<a href="http://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/Overpass_API/Overpass_QL#Augmented_Delta_between_two_dates_.28.22adiff.22.29" rel="nofollow">adiff</a>" keywords.</p> <p>Working with Overpass API ina way is much more convenient than trying to process a full planet history, which takes at least 35GB to download and requires more complex post-processing.</p>
