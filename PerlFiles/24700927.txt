Why does this regex work with and without hyphens / dashes escaped
<p>given the following string:</p> <pre><code>blablabla X-FOO-BAR:blaaaa blafoobla </code></pre> <p>both of these regexes remove the second line</p> <ol> <li><p><code>s/X-FOO-BAR.*?$//gismo</code></p></li> <li><p><code>s/X\-FOO\-BAR.*?$//gismo</code></p></li> </ol> <p>I'm not completely understanding why the regex without the hyphens works in this case. Can someone clear this up for me? I've tested it in both perl and javascript regex engine.</p> <p>Cheers!</p>
<p>You don't need to escape hyphen when it is outside the character class. In the character class, you must place the hypen at the start or at the last. But if you place it in the middle, escaping may work or maynot.</p>
