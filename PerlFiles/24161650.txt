Notepad++ and embedded Perl - syntax highlighting inside specific tag
<p>In order to make <code>Notepad++</code> highlight embedded Perl templates as HTML I've added <code>.ep</code> file extension in style configurator. However, it is very common to have large chunks of pure Perl code in these <code>.ep</code> files, which are marked with <code>&lt;% perl code %&gt;</code> tags.</p> <p>Are there any ways of making <code>Notepad++</code> interpret everything between <code>&lt;%</code> and <code>%&gt;</code> as Perl code and highlight it as Perl, while everything outside these tags should be considered HTML?</p>
<p>Templating Engines such as <code>Template Toolkit</code> have specific syntax that is used inside the delimiters <code>&lt;% perl code %&gt;</code> that is then converted to and executed as Perl during the template execution (just before rendering) so even if you <em>could</em> have <code>perlish</code> syntax highlighting in the template's directive blocks it would not be 100% correct. </p> <p>There are a few editors that support TT style templating <a href="http://www.template-toolkit.org/download/#editors" rel="nofollow">here</a>, but if you want it in <code>Notepad++</code> you will probably have to write the .xml for it (which I imagine a few people will be vary grateful for).</p>
