How to compare each element of an array using regex?
<p>I am using the Lingua::EN::Tagger Perl module in order to tag parts of speech from a user's input. That portion of my code works perfect. However, the problem is that I only want to keep the input that has the noun tags which are "NN, NNS, NNP, NNPS", and store these words in a separate array @nounArray. The user will be inputting a question such as "what is your name?" Each element of the question will be tagged: <code>What/WP is/is your/PN name/NN</code></p> <pre><code>my @UserInput = $readable_text; my @nounArray; foreach my $UserInput (@UserInput){ if ($UserInput =~ m/NN|NNS$|NNP$|NNPS$/){ $UserInput = @nounArray; } print @nounArray; } </code></pre> <p>However, nothing occurs when I run the code. The goal is to have the nouns of the user's input be placed in a separate array after separating them from the original array. I do not want to print the array, but i do this in order to see if the code was working.</p>
<p>First, split your words by whitespace:</p> <pre><code>my @UserInput = split /\s+/, $UserInput; </code></pre> <p>Then <code>grep</code> for the nouns:</p> <pre><code>my @nouns = grep { m%/N% } @UserInput; # only noun tags include /N </code></pre>
<p><code>$</code> matches at the end of the string. I suppose your strings have at least a <code>\n</code> at the end, which would prevent them from matching.</p> <p>But as you point out in your comment, it looks like you're trying to match word boundaries here, so just replace all <code>$</code> in your expression with <code>\b</code>.</p>
<p>Since you want to iterate over the words in <code>$readable_text</code> you can split them first into array,</p> <pre><code>my $readable_text = "What/WP is/is your/PN name/NN"; my @UserInput = split ' ', $readable_text; my @nounArray; foreach my $UserInput (@UserInput) { if ($UserInput =~ m/NN|NNS$|NNP$|NNPS$/) { # print "$UserInput\n"; push @nounArray, $UserInput; } } print @nounArray; </code></pre>
