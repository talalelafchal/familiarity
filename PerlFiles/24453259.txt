Javascript HTML Progress Bar to monitor the running of whole Perl CGI script:
<p>I have been unable to find a solution I can understand. Basically I have a form in the HTML, which submits to a Perl CGI script, this script runs a number of processes which can take approximately 5 minutes, before it returns a results page. I have attempted everything I have found on the internet from CGI::ProgressBar to Ajax, to attempting a simple timed progress bar from HTML5. I will take any solution from basing length of time (15,000kb per minute fro script running time), how can I implement the progress bar to run for this input file size in the form submission on a timer? Alternatively, how can I set up the progress bar to begin upon clicking the submit button, and then run to a set maximum time, whilst printing statements as though in real time? I have no experience in javascript, so please be kind, learning here. Thank you in advance.</p>
