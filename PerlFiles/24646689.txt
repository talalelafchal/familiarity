use strict; behaviour not working as expected in Perl
<p>I have written a sample perl code:</p> <pre><code>use strict; use warnings; $a=1; $b=2; if($b==2) { $a=3; } print $a; </code></pre> <p>Ideally, when I run this code, it should give an error as 'Global symbol "$a" requires explicit package name...' But it is not giving any error. It gives the output as '3'. Why so? As far as I know, if we use strict, then we need to define the scope of the variable otherwise it gives an error. Is my understanding wrong?</p>
<p><code>$a</code> and <code>$b</code> are special variables, and thus are not rising error when used with <code>strict</code>.</p> <p>From <a href="http://perldoc.perl.org/strict.html"><code>perldoc strict</code></a>,</p> <blockquote> <p>Because of their special use by sort(), the variables $a and $b are exempted from this check.</p> </blockquote>
