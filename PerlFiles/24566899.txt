Perl Inline::java module
<p>I am trying to install Inline::Java module in cpan but getting the following error. Please can someone help. Thank you.</p> <pre><code>Welcome to the Inline::Java installation procedure. A Java 2 SDK is required to install and use Inline::Java. Please specify your Java 2 SDK installation directory using the J2SDK option to Makefile.PL as such: perl Makefile.PL J2SDK=/path/to/your/j2sdk/installation You can set the JAVA_HOME environment variable to specify your Java 2 SDK installation directory. For example, if you are using the CPAN installer you can do: JAVA_HOME=/path/to/your/j2sdk/installation cpan Inline::Java Warning: No success on command[/usr/bin/perl Makefile.PL] 'YAML' not installed, will not store persistent state PATL/Inline-Java-0.53.tar.gz /usr/bin/perl Makefile.PL -- NOT OK Running make test Make had some problems, won't test Running make install Make had some problems, won't install Could not read metadata file.

Please throw some light on it for proper understanding for java. Thank you in advance.</p>
