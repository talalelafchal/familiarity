MySQL Collation for Multiple Languages
<p>I have a database containing names of people from all over Europe.</p> <p>Currently I use <code>CHARSET=utf8 COLLATE=utf8_unicode_ci</code> and for most umlauts and 'crazy' symbols this lets me execute a search for things like 'name' and it will return 'name', 'näme', 'namé' and so on.</p> <p>But there are some letters that are not matched, like the German <code>ß</code> which could be matched with <code>s</code>or <code>ss</code> but is not matched at all, and the Scandinavian <code>Ð</code> or <code>ð</code> which should be matched by <code>D</code> <em>and</em> <code>d</code> as the match is case insensitive. The same goes for the Polish <code>Ł</code> or <code>ł</code> which should be matched by <code>l</code>.</p> <p>These are only examples, there are many more which currently don't work.</p> <p>If I understand <a href="http://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.5/en/charset-unicode-sets.html" rel="nofollow">the documentation</a> correctly I could use either <code>utf8_general_ci</code> to fix the <code>ß</code> problem, or <code>utf8_swedish_ci</code>to fix the <code>Ð</code> problem?</p> <p>But is there no way to fix it for all languages?</p>
