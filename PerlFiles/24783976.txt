PCRE pattern match verification between 2 files containing multi line regex and data patterns in linux
<p>I am new to PCRE pattern matching. Would like to know, that if I have a file containing different regex patterns, say file1 containing long list of multiline patterns. Another file, say file2 containing some lines of patterns from file1 (pattern data file).</p> <ol> <li><p>How to verify/find out how many PCRE pattern matches between patterns in file2 and patterns in file1. </p></li> <li><p>Was working with pcretest and pcregrep which accepts only 1 pattern file as source or input. Wondering is there anyway using pcretest or pcregrep tools or any other pcre tool which accepts 2 files to test the pcre pattern matches between them (here file2 over file1) ?</p></li> </ol> <p>Or is there anyway/syntax to pass both, different multiline regex patterns and multiline data patterns in a single file to get the pcre matches between those 2 pattern files?</p> <p>Thanks in advance.</p>
<p>Thanks for readers patience, seems I have found the solution from some other site. This looks very basic, but this is my first time experience with patterns.</p> <p>Say <strong>file1</strong> contains the regex patterns to be tested,<br> and <strong>file2</strong> contains the lines of text patterns to test. </p> <p>Since pcretest can have only 1 file as input, the syntax will be thus, append both these files (file1 &amp; file2) in a file (say <strong>testfile</strong>) such that, Each regex pattern is on the first line, and must be enclosed in delimiters The text patterns to be tested in the next line onwards.</p> <p>If multi lines, then below each delimited regex pattern line, keep all the data pattern lines. </p> <p>Skip a line and again below second delimited regex pattern line keep all the data pattern lines.</p> <p><strong>e.g.,</strong> </p> <p><strong>file1</strong> contains regex patterns </p> <pre><code>Bharat\d{4} bharata(\w+)\b </code></pre> <p><strong>file2</strong> contains data patterns </p> <pre><code>bsgdfr 242 23egjuy Bharati ytf uhouho Bharat567 uhgf poiuhgpoij ygf bkutgl 657 ytfui bharatauwa65 rtesrydu </code></pre> <p>Then <strong>testfile</strong> should be created to contain, </p> <pre><code>/Bharat\d{4}/ bsgdfr 242 23egjuy Bharati ytf uhouho Bharat567 uhgf poiuhgpoij ygf bkutgl 657 ytfui bharatauwa65 rtesrydu /\bharata(\w+)\b/ bsgdfr 242 23egjuy Bharati ytf uhouho Bharat567 uhgf poiuhgpoij ygf bkutgl 657 ytfui bharatauwa65 rtesrydu </code></pre> <p><strong>Now run</strong> </p> <pre><code>pcretest [option flags] testfile resultfile </code></pre> <p>result file has the matches.</p> <p>One can add as many regex pattern lines and lines of data patterns as required. </p>
