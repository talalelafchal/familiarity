Understanding with this regex in Perl without assigment
<p>Can someone explain me how to understand this part of the code The code is extracted from pfLogSumm.pl a log analyzer for postfix mail</p> <pre><code>while(&lt;&gt;) { next if(defined($dateStr) &amp;&amp; ! /^$dateStr/o); s/: \[ID \d+ [^\]]+\] /: /o; # lose "[ID nnnnnn some.thing]" stuff my $logRmdr; more code } </code></pre> <p>I can't undestand what the regex is doing because don't have a assigment, don't have a conditional, simple is there</p> <p>Thanks</p>
<p>By default, regular expressions (and many other functions) operate on <code>$_</code>. So </p> <pre><code>s/: \[ID \d+ [^\]]+\] /: /o; </code></pre> <p>is equivalent to:</p> <pre><code>$_ =~ s/: \[ID \d+ [^\]]+\] /: /o; </code></pre> <p>This replaces <code>: [ID number ...]</code> with just <code>:</code> in the input line.</p> <p>This is a common idiom that you should see in many Perl scripts, you should be used to it.</p>
