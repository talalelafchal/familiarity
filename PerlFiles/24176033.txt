How to get Jenkins &quot;Console Output&quot; after triggering build remotely?
<p>I am using a Perl script to trigger a build in Jenkins using LWP modules. This works but after executing the job, I would like to parse the console output.</p> <p>Is there someway to get this?</p>
<p>Use the <code>Log Parser Plugin</code> for Jenkins. Read the <a href="http://www.packtpub.com/sites/default/files/9781849517409-Chapter-01.pdf" rel="nofollow">page number 24 here</a> for the configuration and other details.</p>
<p>Log into Jenkins and take a look at the bottom of the webpage near the right hand side and click on the <code>REST API</code> link. This will give you information about the Jenkins <a href="http://www.restapitutorial.com">RESTful API</a> which is a great way to pull information off of Jenkins once you understand how to construct the URL.</p> <p>And, here's how you get the console text:</p> <pre><code>$ curl "$JENKINS_URL/job/$JOB_NAME/lastBuild/consoleText </code></pre> <p>You can use Perl's various <a href="https://metacpan.org/pod/LWP">LWP</a> modules to talk to Jenkins.</p>
