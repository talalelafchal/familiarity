<p>For extracting UUID you'll need to configure <a href="http://jmeter.apache.org/usermanual/component_reference.html#Regular_Expression_Extractor" rel="nofollow">Regular Expression Extractor</a> Post Processor as follows:</p> <ul> <li>Reference Name: anything meaningful, i.e. <strong>UUID</strong></li> <li>Regular Expression: for Version 4 UUID it would be something like <strong>([a-f0-9]{8}-[a-f0-9]{4}-4[a-f0-9]{3}-[89aAbB][a-f0-9]{3}-[a-f0-9]{12})</strong> </li> <li>Template: <strong>$1$</strong></li> </ul> <p>You can test your regular expression against returned data using <a href="http://jmeter.apache.org/usermanual/component_reference.html#View_Results_Tree" rel="nofollow">View Results Tree</a> Listener (select RegExp Tester from dropdown)</p> <p>For more information refer to <a href="http://community.blazemeter.com/knowledgebase/articles/65150-using-regex-regular-expression-extractor-with-jm" rel="nofollow">Using RegEx (Regular Expression Extractor) with JMeter</a> guide. </p>
