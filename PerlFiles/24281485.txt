Perl one-liner error in Windows
<p>I have a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/One-liner_program#Perl" rel="nofollow">Perl one-liner</a> which will read a file and remvove the first field of each line, which are separated by comma and dump the rest.</p> <p><code>perl -wan -e 'for (@F) { if (/(aaa),(.*)/) {$text = $2; $text =~ s/$1// ; print "$text\n";}}'</code></p> <p>Where aaa is in the first field of each line. This is working fine in Linux, but in Windows it is throwing an error:</p> <blockquote> <p>Can't find string terminator "'" anywhere before EOF at -e line 1.`</p> </blockquote> <p>Why is it behaving differently?</p>
<p>You might want to use double instead of single quotes. This might impose problems for quoted text <code>"$text\n"</code> which can be replaced by perl alternative quoting <code>qq{$text\n}</code></p> <pre><code>perl -wane "for (@F) { if (/(aaa),(.*)/) {$text = $2; $text =~ s/$1//; print qq{$text\n}; }}" </code></pre>
<p>In MS Windows, single quotes don't work as in Linux. You have to switch to double quotes.</p> <pre><code>perl -wan -e "for (@F) { if (/(aaa),(.*)/) {$text = $2; $text =~ s/$1// ; print qq($text\n);}}" </code></pre> <p>I used <code>qq</code> for the nested double quotes.</p>
