What is this error “Attempt to free unreferenced scalar”?
<p>I am invoking a perl script from nodejs and getting errors like:</p> <pre><code>Attempt to free unreferenced scalar: SV 0x15810d8 during global destruction. Attempt to free unreferenced scalar: SV 0x15810d8 during global destruction. Attempt to free unreferenced scalar: SV 0x15cffb8 during global destruction. Attempt to free unreferenced scalar: SV 0x15cffb8 during global destruction. Segmentation fault </code></pre> <p>Can anyone tell me which kind of error is this and how to debug it because it is simply ending the node process without giving any valuable information.</p>
<p>In effect, it is Perl/XS's equivalent of a double-<code>free()</code> bug. It indicates that some SV has been unreferenced twice from XS code (likely once during some cleanup, and then once again during the <code>FREETMPS</code> between statements). This is indicative of some kind of bug in some XS code you have called; possibly indirectly several layers down.</p>
