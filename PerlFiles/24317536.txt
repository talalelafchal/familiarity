how to make a one-digit number a capture group
<p>I want to connect the below in perl</p> <pre><code>ab0 with NC_ab0 ab1 with NC_ab1 ... </code></pre> <p>I want to use something like</p> <pre><code>Connect ab\d ab${1}. </code></pre> <p>However, the <code>\d</code> can't form a capture group. Any idea how I can make it a capture group and use <code>${1}</code> to refer to it?</p> <p>Thanks</p>
<p>Just put parenthesis around the <code>\d</code> if you want to match that value to somewhere else in your regex.</p> <p>Then use <code>\1</code> to refer to the capture group in the LHS of the regex, as <code>$1</code> is meant for use in the RHS of a substitution.</p> <pre><code>use strict; use warnings; while (&lt;DATA&gt;) { if (/ab(\d) with NC_ab\1/) { print; } } __DATA__ ab0 with NC_ab0 ab1 with NC_ab1 ab1 with NC_ab5 ab3 with NC_ab1 </code></pre> <p>Outputs:</p> <pre><code>ab0 with NC_ab0 ab1 with NC_ab1 </code></pre> <p>This is my current best guess by what your question meant. If this is incorrect, please reframe the question.</p>
