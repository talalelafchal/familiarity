Perl: Adding semicolon (;) when block ends
<p>This question may sound foolish, but it's important to me to be 100% sure that I do the right thing, so I decided to ask it here although this.</p> <p>I've encountered in someone else's code <strong>if</strong> statements, which their blocks end with semicolon (;).</p> <p>I guess these semicolons has no effect, but I want to be fully sure about it.</p> <p>So can you please tell me? Is there any difference between the following code snippets?</p> <p>With semicolon:</p> <pre><code>if ($var) { print "hi\n"; }; </code></pre> <p>Without semicolon:</p> <pre><code>if ($var) { print "hi\n"; } </code></pre> <p>Thanks!</p>
<p>They are completely equivalent if there is no <code>else</code> block. With an <code>else</code> block the semicolon is not allowed.</p>
<pre><code>if ($var) { print "hi\n"; }; </code></pre> <p>is to</p> <pre><code>if ($var) { print "hi\n" } </code></pre> <p>as</p> <pre><code>print "hi\n";; </code></pre> <p>is to</p> <pre><code>print "hi\n"; </code></pre> <p>You have two statements, the latter of which is empty. An empty statement does nothing.</p> <pre><code>$ perl -e'print "hi\n";;;;;;;;;;;;;' hi </code></pre>
