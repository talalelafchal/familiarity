Anyway to know in perl if file is modified without polling?
<p>I just want to get some sort of notification in my perl script when particular file is modified. </p> <p>Is there any other way rather than just polling it constantly?</p>

Neither of the existing modules seem to work with well with an event loop. Filesys::Notify::Simple does not supply a non-blocking interface and File::ChangeNotify requires you to poll an method for new events.</p> </blockquote>
