not able to send bulkmail through sendmail
<p>I am trying to send e-mail to a group but not being able to send catch is my script is sending e-mail to individual id, but not group.</p> <p>Googled it but not much helpful.</p> <p>For sending to bulk users i don't want to use alias, some restrictions.</p> <p>Please Advice</p> <pre><code>#!/usr/bin/perl #!/usr/sbin/sendmail $to = 'xxxx@yyy.something.com,'; $from = 'abc@something.com'; $subject = 'Subject'; #$message = 'This is test mail'; open(MAIL, "|/usr/sbin/sendmail -t"); # Email Header print MAIL "To: $to\n"; print MAIL "From: $from\n"; print MAIL "Subject: $subject\n\n"; # Email Body print MAIL "print something"; close(MAIL); #print "Email Sent Successfully\n </code></pre>
<p>Pass list of recipients as sendmail command line arguments - AFAIR it should work on Linuxes for a few hundredth recipients. </p> <pre><code>#!/usr/bin/perl use strict; use warnings; my @to = ('xxxx@yyy.something.com','yyyy@xxx.something.com'); my $from = 'abc@something.com'; my $subject = 'Subject'; #my $child_pid = open(MAIL, "|-") // die "can't fork: $!"; defined( my $child_pid = open(MAIL, "|-")) || die "can't fork: $!"; if( $child_pid == 0 ) { exec( '/usr/sbin/sendmail', '-i', '--', @to) || die "can't exec: $!"; } # Email Headers &amp; Body print MAIL &lt;&lt; "END" ; From: $from Subject: $subject print something END close(MAIL) &amp;&amp; print "Email Sent Successfully\n"; </code></pre>
