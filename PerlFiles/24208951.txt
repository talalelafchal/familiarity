Unable to open EMS file type using Perl OPEN - but opens when the content is copied to notepad
<p>I am unable to open a large EMS Format file using Perl OPEN. But, when the same content is manually copied to notepad, the one in notepad opens. I don't want to do the manual copy, please let me how I can open the file with EMS file type. </p> <p>Here is the code I am using, it works with .txt file, but not the .ems file.</p> <pre><code>#!/usr/bin/perl use strict; use warnings; # open a filehandle to data.txt open( IN, "C:\\Users\\test\\Documents\\lOGS\\Testing\hourly.txt" ) || die('cannot open file: ' . $!); my @Required = ( 28, 385, 38, 708, 722, 379, 380, 32, 76, 388, 389, 62, 739, 319, 83 ); for ( 1 .. 2 ) { &lt;IN&gt;; } while ( my $line = &lt;IN&gt; ) { my @fields = split( /:/, $line ); for ( $count = 0 ; $count &lt;= 15 ; $count++ ) { if ( $fields[0] == $Required[$count] ) { print $line; } } } # close the filehandle and exit close(IN); exit; </code></pre>
<p>The EMS format is not a simple block of text. Different file formats exist such as DOC, DOCX, EMS. You can open all those using standard utilities such as Notepad, and Wordpad. However, just because you see text displayed, does not mean that is the only data inside those files. What makes a DOC file a DOC file? There is a standard specification that describes the file format, such as header data (how do you tell the OS it's a DOC file?) and where data is stored (where do you store the # of pages, the fonts used, the actual text?). </p> <p>The EMS file is like that as well. I don't have experience or an easy specification sheet about the EMS format, but perhaps you can use <a href="http://perldoc.perl.org/functions/binmode.html" rel="nofollow">http://perldoc.perl.org/functions/binmode.html</a> to open the file and read the data in bytes and then search for the text information that you want. That's reverse engineering for you.</p>
