make a list of directories by creation date
<p>I have a list of directories, each with 1 file in them, I need to access the file with the latest date.</p> <p>Can i make a list of directories by date then take the last one? If so how can I do this, I have seen some questions about sorting files by date, but never directories.</p> <p>Many thanks in advance</p>
<p>The fact that you have a list of directories with single files in them is extraneous.</p> <p>Ultimately, you just have a list of files with paths (or you'll build one), and then you can <a href="http://perldoc.perl.org/List/Util.html" rel="nofollow"><code>reduce</code></a> the list to the file with most recent modified date (<a href="http://perldoc.perl.org/functions/-X.html" rel="nofollow"><code>-M</code></a>):</p> <pre><code>use strict; use warnings; use List::Util qw(reduce); my @files = qw( foo/file.txt bar/file.txt baz/file.txt ); my $youngest = reduce {-M $a &lt; -M $b ? $a : $b} @files; print $youngest, "\n"; </code></pre>
