Error while installing GETOPT::LONG perl module
<p>I am trying to install getopt::long . however, I am getting the below error. Is there a way to manually remove the files and where can I find which files need to be removed.</p> <pre><code>C:\Users\sastagi\Desktop\Getopt-Long-2.42&gt;perl Makefile.pl Set up gcc environment - 3.4.5 (mingw-vista special r3) I found left-over files from a previous version of Getopt::Long. These should be removed. I can add instructions to the Makefile to remove them when you install this version. Shall I add the remove instructions? y Generating a dmake-style Makefile Writing Makefile for Getopt::Long Writing MYMETA.yml and MYMETA.json </code></pre>
