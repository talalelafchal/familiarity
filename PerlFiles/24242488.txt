How to delete all words except numbers and a given list?
<p>I am trying to delete all the words in a string except the numbers and a given list ('dummy' is used as an example here). I have been able to make some progress and reached the following stage.</p> <pre><code>$s =~ s/[^\W\-\,0-9\s\.{dummy}]//g; </code></pre> <p>There are two problems with this â€” the words which are subset of dummy are not deleted and it leaves out characters like <code>%</code> etc.</p> <p>Here are the sample outputs.</p> <p>Input String: <code>I scored 75% in the final examination.</code></p> <p>Output String: <code>d 75% m.</code></p> <p>But the output should be <code>75 .</code> instead.</p> <p>EDIT: It may not have been clear from the wording of my question but I also need to have the punctuation marks like the '.' at the end or any other place without disturbing the order in which they appear. Please note that I also need to remove special characters like the carriage return.</p>
<p><code>$s =~ s/\D+//g;</code> for this example that should be fine. \D is = NON NUMERIC.</p> <p>Or you need the last dot?</p>
<p>For punctuation you can use the Unicode class 'Punct'.</p> <pre><code>use strict; use warnings; my $s = 'I scored 75% in the final examination.'; $s =~ s/\b(dummy|final)\b|[^\d\p{Punct}]/$1 if defined $1/eg; print "$s\n"; </code></pre> <p>However, it includes both <code>.</code> and <code>%</code>. So as to keep particular punctuation marks you might want to define your own set.</p> <pre><code>use strict; use warnings; my $s = 'I scored 75% in the final examination.'; $s =~ s/\b(dummy|final)\b|[^\d.,;]/$1 if defined $1/eg; print "$s\n"; </code></pre>
