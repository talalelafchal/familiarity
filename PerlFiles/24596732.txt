Set Perl-Scripts and MySql Database to UTF8: German Umlaute work only with Cyrillic Characters in Comments
<p>I converted my MySQL database and my perl scripts to UTF-8. And finally it worked, but it is somehow a crazy solution. That's what I did:</p> <p>MYSQL DATABASE: Completely set to UTF8</p> <p>PERL-SCRIPTS: Source code converted to UTF8 encoding. "use utf8;" at the top.</p> <p>HTML-HEADERS:</p> <pre> print "Content-type: text/html\n\n";</pre> <p>and</p> <pre> &ltMETA CHARSET='UTF-8'></pre> <p>DATABASE-CONNECTS:</p> <pre> $dbh->{'mysql_enable_utf8'} = 1;</pre> <p>and</p> <pre> "set names 'utf8';"</pre> <p>Now, everything works with cyrillic (russian) characters: input, output and processing in the database, fine. But the problem I have are German "Umlaute": äöü. They are not shown correctly in the browser. They work only if I put a cyrillic character in a comment next to the HTML element which does not show the character, e.g. something like this:</p> <pre> &lt!-- Э --></pre> <p>This is an awkward solutions, and I know that there has to be a solution without that. Does anybody know what could be missing. Thanks in advance for every answer! <BR><BR> UPDATE:</p> <p>Thank you for you response. I figured out, that I have the problem even with the most simple HTML file. I use this source code:</p> <pre><code>#!/usr/bin/perl use utf8; print "Content-Type: text/html; charset=utf-8\n\n"; print &lt;&lt;END; &lt;HTML&gt; &lt;HEAD&gt; &lt;META CHARSET='UTF-8'&gt; &lt;/HEAD&gt; &lt;BODY&gt; &lt;H1&gt;The Country Österreich&lt;/H1&gt; &lt;/BODY&gt; &lt;/HTML&gt; END </code></pre> <p>The result can be seen at: <a href="http://5mls.com/test_bad.cgi" rel="nofollow">http://5mls.com/test_bad.cgi</a><BR> As you can see, the "Ö" is not shown.<BR> Now the code that works:</p> <pre><code>#!/usr/bin/perl use utf8; print "Content-Type: text/html; charset=utf-8\n\n"; print &lt;&lt;END; &lt;HTML&gt; &lt;HEAD&gt; &lt;META CHARSET='UTF-8'&gt; &lt;/HEAD&gt; &lt;BODY&gt; &lt;H1&gt;The Country Österreich&lt;!-- Э --&gt;&lt;/H1&gt; &lt;/BODY&gt; &lt;/HTML&gt; END </code></pre> <p>The result can be seen at: <a href="http://5mls.com/test_good.cgi" rel="nofollow">http://5mls.com/test_good.cgi</a><BR> This time the "Ö" is shown correctly, because of the Russian character "Э" in the comment. Does anybody know, how the "Ö" could be shown without the Russian character?</p>
