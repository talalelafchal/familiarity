<p>I am on a virtual machine with Debian (6.0.7-i386) and i want to learn Perl (with Beginning Perl written by Curtis Poe).</p> <p>I have trouble with <code>perlbrew</code>.</p> <ol> <li><p>I installed <code>perlbrew</code> with</p> <pre><code>wget --no-check-certificate -O - http://install.perlbrew.pl | bash </code></pre></li> <li><p>I add the following command to <code>~/.bashrc</code>:</p> <pre><code>source ~/perl5/perlbrew/etc/bashrc </code></pre></li> <li><p>After that, I logged out and logged back, and then I ran the following command:</p> <pre><code>perlbrew install perl-5.14.2 </code></pre></li> </ol> <p>I got</p> <p><img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/caE0L.png" alt="enter image description here"></p> <p>Please help me</p> <hr> <p>English translation of the output:</p> <pre class="lang-none prettyprint-override"><code>tar (child): bzip2: Cannot exec: No such file or directory tar (child): Error is not recoverable: exiting now /bin/tar: Child returned status 2 /bin/tar: Error is not recoverable: exiting now </code></pre>
<p>It's failing because the <code>bzip2</code> command line utility isn't installed (can't be found in the PATH).</p>
<p>Thank you ikegami, it was that.</p> <p>I did this </p> <pre><code>aptitude install bzip2 </code></pre> <p>and now it's working.</p>
