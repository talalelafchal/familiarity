CGI script to connect to unix host and trigger perl script and report back the status
<p>I need some heads up here. I need to write a CGI script which has to connect unix host and execute set of perl scripts. I am new to CGI world and I have couple of questions in my mind for which I don't know perl solution.</p> <ol> <li>How will connect to Unix host from CGI script. I believe using <code>Net::SSH</code> ,is there any better module to do this ?</li> <li><p>Lets assume I have connected to the server , now how would I execute the script and how would I now the status (running/success/failure) of the script.</p> <p>a. When its running I would like to see the output that gets generated. Is it possible to view the script output in realtime?</p> <p>b. If its a failure then I should be notified and reason for failure and should not trigger the next script in sequence.</p></li> </ol> <p>If someone has similar setup already available and ready to show the code/setup , I would be much happier :)</p>
