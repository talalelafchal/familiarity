How to ensure that Net::SCP::Expect does not store hash key in know host file
<p>I am writing a perl script where I perform scp to copy certain files into a VM. Initially, while scripting, I faced problems with known host, and tried option auto_yes to 1. Even that did not work. Later I tried "option => 'StrictHostKeyChecking=no'" and it worked. </p> <p>However, when I run the same script in a specific test environment where same set to VMs are created and destroyed before and after script runs, I enter into a situation where in SCP fails as the hash does not match in known host file. </p> <p>Is there a way in which I can skip know host checking + hash mismatch when same set of VMs are created and destroyed on fly </p>
