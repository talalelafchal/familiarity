Create webmail account via Perl
<p>In my project I need to programmatically create e-mail accounts to every new user that subscribing in my site. </p> <p>I understood that it can be done via SSH, so I installed <a href="https://metacpan.org/pod/Net%3a%3aSSH%3a%3aPerl" rel="nofollow"><code>Net::SSH::Perl</code></a>, below is my code:</p> <pre><code>use Net::SSH::Perl; my $ssh = Net::SSH::Perl-&gt;new("IP of my server"); $ssh-&gt;login('username like in ftp', 'password of my ftp'); # I assume the password to SSH is the same as to my cPanel account my($stdout, $stderr, $exit) = $ssh-&gt;cmd("/scripts/addpop CGA_$uid\@crazygao.com $cps 20"); # 20MB quota </code></pre> <p>But I get the following error: </p> <pre><code>Can't connect to [IP], port 22: Connection refused at /home/mydomain/perl/usr/share/perl5/Net/SSH/Perl.pm line 208. </code></pre> <p>I am on shared Linux host, I set up public and private keys for accessing the <strong>SSH</strong>, and it still not working...<br> I think I am just walking the long way home - maybe there is an easier way to create mail accounts in Perl, but I just simply don't know how to achieve this goal... </p>
