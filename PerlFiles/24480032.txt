failed to run pt-table-checksum
<p>OS: suse linux enterprise server 11 sp1 mysql: 5.6.17 perl: 5.10.0 pt-table-checksum: percona-toolkit-2.2.8-1.noarch.rpm</p> <p>There is an error while I run pt-table-checksum: 06-30T04:27:53 install_driver(mysql) failed: Attempt to reload DBD/mysql.pm aborted. Compilation failed in require at (eval 16) line 3. at /usr/bin/pt-table-checksum line 1569</p> <p>I think this should be caused by perl-DBD-mysql. </p> <p>I have changed version from perl-DBD-mysql-4.008-4.2.x86_64.rpm to perl-DBD-mysql-4.021-27.1.x86_64.rpm. Installation is successful, but the problem is still there. </p> <p>I don't know how to fix it.</p>
<p>I fixed above problem since the slave mysql was binded to 127.0.0.1, so I can not access it remotely. the solution is to commit the line in my.cnf: bind-address = 127.0.0.1.</p> <p>But there is another error getting while running pt-table-checksum:</p> <p>Waiting for the --replicate table to replicate to my slave server... Waiting for the --replicate table to replicate to my slave server ... Waiting for the --replicate table to replicate to my slave server ...</p> <p>then nothing return. how to fix this issue? </p>
