use perl regex in Java
<p>I am trying to use regular expressions in Java that are built for Perl's regex. My goal is to have a standardized set of regular expressions so that both our Java apps and Perl scripts are producing the same results when applying the regular expressions.</p> <p>Is there a library that will take a perl regex such as: <code>\bbypa(s|r)?\b</code> and use it directly in Java or do I need to escape special characters for each regular expression?</p> <p>If I have to implement the second method (which I hope I can avoid), what are the characters that need to be escaped to function in Java?</p> <p>Any insight into this will be helpful</p> <p>Thanks!!</p> <p>EDIT:</p> <p>I have over 500 of these regular expressions sitting in the database. They all work perfect on perl. Do I just need to escape the backslashes when using these regex in Java and assume it produces the same results as Perl?</p>
<p>Your java regex would be,</p> <pre><code>"\\bbypa(s|r)?\\b" </code></pre> <p>You need to escape the backslash <code>\</code> one more time. Just put your perl regex into this <a href="http://www.regexplanet.com/advanced/java/index.html" rel="nofollow">javaregex online checker</a> site and click on test button. You would get a pure java regex code.</p>
<p>You can use that expression, in Java you must double escape the backslash escape sequences.</p> <pre><code> \\bbypa(s|r)?\\b </code></pre>
