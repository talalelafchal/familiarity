Problems with modules after installing a new perl
<p>Until recently I exclusively used perl 5.18 under perlbrew on Mac OS X.</p> <p>I installed perl 5.20 under berlbrew in order to try waack <a href="https://github.com/yanick/waack" rel="nofollow">https://github.com/yanick/waack</a> (very cool, BTW), and had to reinstall a few modules (DBI, Sub::Base) under the new perlbrew with cpanm.</p> <p>Since then, if I try to work under 5.18, I seem to get problem with every non-pure-perl module.</p> <p>I can see that XS portions of modules are not installed under the version-dependent perl, like in this case:</p> <pre><code>~/perl5/lib/perl5/darwin-2level/auto/Sub/Name/Name.bs </code></pre> <p>and I see that I also have an older version installed under the right perlbrew like this:</p> <pre><code>~/perl5/perlbrew/perls/perl-5.18.2/lib/site_perl/5.18.2/darwin-2level/auto/Sub/Name/Name.bs </code></pre> <p>Any idea of what mess I've gotten myself into? and how to fix it?</p> <p>Thanks.</p>
<p>I would suggest testing your installs first. </p> <pre><code>$ perlbrew switch perl-5.18.2 $ cpanm --interactive -v App::cpanoutdated $ cpan-outdated $ cpanm --interactive -v App::CPAN::Fresh $ perlbrew switch perl-5.20.0 $ cpanm --interactive -v App::cpanoutdated $ cpan-outdated $ cpanm --interactive -v App::CPAN::Fresh </code></pre> <p>Source: <a href="http://blog.fox.geek.nz/2010/09/installing-multiple-perls-with.html" rel="nofollow">Kent's blog</a></p>
