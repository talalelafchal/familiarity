How can I get the __LINE__ for calling function?
<p>Basically, my question is <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/17016370/automatically-use-line-and-file-relative-to-where-function-is-called">this</a> except for perl rather than PHP.</p> <p>I know warn() manages it, but then again warn() is core perl, so I'd understand if it weren't generally possible.</p> <h2>Addendum (in case that link fails eventually)</h2> <p>have a function </p> <pre><code>sub logm { my ($msg, $line_no) = @_; # ... } </code></pre> <p>I would like to include __LINE__ (and __FILE__, but that's not necessary), but don't want to include it as a parameter each time as I currently do.</p> <pre><code># This is attrocious logm "That file handle is now closed", __LINE__; </code></pre>
<p>Check <a href="http://perldoc.perl.org/functions/caller.html"><code>caller</code></a> function,</p> <pre><code>sub logm { my ($msg) = @_; my ($package, $filename, $line) = caller; print "'$msg' from file:$filename; line:$line\n"; } logm("message"); </code></pre>
