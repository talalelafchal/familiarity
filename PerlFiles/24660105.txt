Perl Hash with dynamic key values...Getting wiered results! Please advice
<p>I'm trying to build a hash with variable key values and the keys are same as values and then I'm trying to retreive a specific value for a specific key.here is the code and I'm getting exactly what I want. My porblem is when I try to keep the peice of the code in a subroutine and call it from there I'm getting null! can someone expian why?</p> <p>Here is the working code;</p> <pre><code> my @ary = qw(apple mango orrange grape); my %dir; foreach my $list (@ary) { $dir{$list} = "$list"; } my $file = $dir{mango}; print("$file\n"); </code></pre> <p>getiing the result : mango as expected:</p> <p>Here is the code which is not working: ( which is in the main porgram)</p> <pre><code> my %dir; foreach my $list ( @show ) { $dir{$list} = "$list"; # print $dir{$list} . "\n"; } while ( my ($key,$value ) = each %dir ) { print("$key -&gt; $value\n"); } ### I'm genuinley getting the key values as expected##### my $file1 = $dir{apple}; my $file2 = $dir{mango }; print("Required files is : $file1" . "\n" . $file2 ."\n"); </code></pre> <p>getting nothing!!!</p>
<p>I assume this is your code:</p> <pre><code>my @show = qw(apple mango orrange grape); my %dir; foreach my $list ( @show ) { $dir{$list} = "$list"; # print $dir{$list} . "\n"; } my $file1 = $dir{apple}; my $file2 = $dir{mango}; print("Required files is : $file1" . "\n" . $file2 ."\n"); </code></pre> <p>You should get a value print out. The only time you wouldn't get anything is if your @show array is initialized with something else(no mango, no apple).</p>
