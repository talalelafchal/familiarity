OSX 10.6 &quot;make&quot; command not working
<p>I've worked on this problem for a few days and couldn't find any solution even after reading several other blogs.</p> <p>Whenever I try to install modules using CPAN, these installs fail since 'make' errors.</p> <pre><code>cpan[1]&gt; install Clone CPAN: Storable loaded ok (v2.18) Reading '/Users/erikhanschen/.cpan/Metadata' Database was generated on Wed, 11 Jun 2014 12:06:12 GMT CPAN: YAML loaded ok (v0.92) CPAN: Time::HiRes loaded ok (v1.9711) Reading 49 yaml files from /Users/erikhanschen/.cpan/build/ DONE Restored the state of none (in 1.7859 secs) Running install for module 'Clone' GARU/Clone-0.37.tar.gz Has already been unwrapped into directory /Users/erikhanschen/.cpan/build/Clone-0.37-F3R5u0 GARU/Clone-0.37.tar.gz Has already been prepared GARU/Clone-0.37.tar.gz Could not make: Unknown error CPAN: CPAN::Meta loaded ok (v2.120351) cpan[2]&gt; </code></pre> <p>After I had to replaced my hard drive recently, I had to re-install Xcode but even after that, the make command didn't work.

I'm thinking the next step is to upgrade to 10.7, 10.8, or 10.9 and try to reinstall Command Line Tools straight from Apple. </p> <p>Thoughts?</p>
<blockquote> <p>I had to re-install Xcode but even after that, the make command didn't work...</p> </blockquote> <p>Install Command Line tools. Open Xcode, and then go to <strong><em>Xcode → Preferences → Downloads</em></strong>.</p>
