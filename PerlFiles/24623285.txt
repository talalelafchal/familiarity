<p>HTML-HTMLDoc is unavailable in PPM, because there aren't any builds for it in the package repositories. </p> <p>Details: <a href="https://code.activestate.com/ppm/HTML-HTMLDoc/" rel="nofollow">https://code.activestate.com/ppm/HTML-HTMLDoc/</a></p>
<p>Have you installed the <a href="https://www.msweet.org/projects.php/HTMLDOC" rel="nofollow">htmldoc</a> program? The module can't pass its tests without that installed, which is why there are no PPM packages. ActiveState doesn't have it installed on their build servers.</p> <p>I'd try manually unpacking the HTML-HTMLDoc tarball and running <code>perl Makefile.PL</code> and <code>dmake</code> manually to see more detail about what's happening.</p>
<p>Last time I looked, HTML::HTMLDoc had terrible support for Unicode. Which is why I spent some time in 2012 ripping it out of a legacy codebase and replacing it with <a href="https://metacpan.org/pod/release/PHILIP/PDF-WebKit-0.91/lib/PDF/WebKit.pm" rel="nofollow">PDF::WebKit</a> (which is a thin wrapper around <a href="http://wkhtmltopdf.org/" rel="nofollow">wkhtmltopdf</a>). I'd recommend that route.</p>
