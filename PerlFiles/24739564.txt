How do I reference a file path containing spaces in Perl?
<p>All I want to do is read in a list of directories from a file and list the files in the directories. The problem is that the directory paths have spaces in them, so this doesn't work:</p> <pre><code>#!/usr/bin/perl use File::Spec; open DIRNAMES, "&lt;./dirnames"; while(my $dirname=&lt;DIRNAMES&gt;) { opendir DIR,$dirname or die $!; while (my $file = readdir(DIR)) { # Use a regular expression to ignore files beginning with a period next if ($file =~ m/^\./); print "$file\n"; } closedir(DIR); } exit 0; </code></pre> <p>Nothing seems to work in line 6; $dirname doesn't work, neother does "$dirname", nor $"dirname" </p>
<p>You forgot to remove the newline ending at the end of the line you placed in <code>$dirname</code>. Just add</p> <pre><code>chomp($dirname); </code></pre>
