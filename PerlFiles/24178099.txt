Storing Regular Expression in variable and then finding pattern(Perl)?
<p>Hi I have problem with regular expression in Perl. If i store the regular expression in variable in perl it is not able to match. Why its like that? How can i resolve this issue? Below is my code which prints Failed as output:</p> <pre><code>my $str1 = 'abc..'; my $str2 = 'abcde'; my $pcode = $str1; print $pcode; if( $pcode =~ /$str2/) { print "Got"; } else { print "Failed"; } </code></pre>
<p>You need to invert your logic. The regex goes inside the <code>//</code>, not the string.</p> <p>Give your variables better names, and it becomes more apparent when you've inverted your logic like that.</p> <pre><code>my $pattern = 'abc..'; my $string = 'abcde'; if ($string =~ /$pattern/) { print "Got"; } else { print "Failed"; } </code></pre>
<p>Your <code>if( $pcode =~ /$str2/)</code> is in the wrong order. You need to change it:</p> <pre><code>if( $str2 =~ /$pcode/) </code></pre> <p>Basically, <code>$pcode</code> contains the Pattern, so its inside the <code>//</code> and the string which you want to check against a pattern comes in front of the <code>=~</code></p>
