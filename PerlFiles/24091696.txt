Perl Net::Bluetooth module
<p>I was looking for a Perl Bluetooth CPAN module. The only one that I could find was <a href="http://search.cpan.org/~addutko/Net-Bluetooth/Bluetooth.pm" rel="nofollow">Net::Bluetooth</a>. The last time it was updated was in 2007. For Windows installation, it needs Service Pack 2 installed and also the Microsoft Platform SDK. When I looked for them, it seems those SDKs are now obsolete and new Windows SDKs have been issued. I even tried the latest SDK (available for and on XP) after modifying the makefile as it suggested. That did not work either. </p> <p>Is there any other Perl Bluetooth module that I can use that work on Windows XP/7? </p>
