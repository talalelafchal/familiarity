How to build CPAN Perl Module 32-bit and 64-bit
<p>I'm attempting to build a CPAN module, and I require both the 32 and 64-bit versions of this module for use on different machines. I'm not familiar with the way to build 32 and 64 bit versions of modules. I've attempted to download the pre-built module from ActivePerl PPM, but unfortunately I don't have the funds to purchase an enterprise license required for the compiled 64-bit modules.</p> <p>My question is: Can I simply download the module source from CPAN, build it on a 32-bit machine for the 32-bit version, and build the same module on a 64-bit PC for the 64-bit version?</p> <p>I would appreciate any assistance with this.</p> <p>Thank You,</p> <p>Russ</p>
<p>Yes, you can do that, though I'd only do that if I didn't want to use <code>cpan</code> for some reason.</p> <p>Using the standard Perl installers, the module is first installed into a <code>blib</code> directory inside the build directory by <code>make</code> or <code>Build</code>. These are the files that are tested by <code>make test</code> or <code>Build test</code>, and these are the files that are installed by <code>make install</code> or <code>Build install</code>.</p> <p>If you have two sufficiently similar machines, you can build the module on one machine, and install it on another from the files in <code>blib</code>. That's what <code>ppm</code> does.</p> <p>Note that you can easily create a ppd for use by ppm by following <a href="http://jenda.krynicky.cz/perl/PPM.html" rel="nofollow">these instructions</a>.</p>
