How to pass variables from one module to another?
<p>I would like to pass a variable from a module to another. I googled how to do this, and quickly found the <code>Exporter</code> documentation, which told me NOT to ever export variable names. </p> <p>One of my modules reads a path from configuration file; I would prefer to pass that path to another module rather than have that module read it again...is this allowed?</p>
<p>You can share global variables between modules. I use it mostly to share debug flag across all the module's submodules, without having to use the var full name:</p> <pre><code># in main module: our $DEBUG; # in sub module: our $DEBUG; *DEBUG = \$MainModule::DEBUG; </code></pre> <p>Then you can just check $DEBUG in the submodule too. if someone changes it in for one of the variables, everyone sees the new value automatically.</p> <p>That said, it is good for debug flags. In your case, I'd recommend making a singleton configuration module, so you will be able to use:</p> <pre><code>my $path = App::Config-&gt;get_path(); # or maybe: my $path = $app-&gt;config-&gt;get_path(); </code></pre> <p>from everywhere in the program. </p>
