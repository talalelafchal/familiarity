Change Jenkins include
<p>I have some modules installed through local lib. This is because I don't have root access. Now I'm trying to use those modules in a Jenkins Job. At the moment when I run Jenkins, it complains about not finding my Perl modules which are installed in my local lib.</p> <pre><code>Can't locate Devel/Cover.pm in @INC (you may need to install the Devel::Cover module) (@INC contains: usr/bin/perl </code></pre> <p>I have this module installed in /home/mattias/perl5/lib/perl5/ </p> <p>The things I have tried to fix this is:</p> <p>1 Change PERL5LIB in Jenkins with the help of a string parameter:</p> <pre><code> RUN_CMD export PERL5LIB= /home/mattias/perl5/lib/perl5 </code></pre> <p>2 Using the -I flag when I run the script</p> <pre><code>perl -I -MDevel::Cover /home/mattias/script.pl </code></pre> <p>Since I dont have access to Jenkins @INC I can't add the modules there. It has to go through my local lib. The most important module that is needed to be used is Devel::Cover.</p> <p>Anyone have any suggestions? </p> <p>// Mattias</p>
<p><em>At the moment when I run Jenkins, it complains about not finding my Perl modules which are installed in local::lib.</em></p> <p>local::lib is not a valid unix directory. What is the exact path where you installed the module Devel::Cover? You will have to add that path to @INC. <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/841785/how-do-i-include-a-perl-module-thats-in-a-different-directory">Here's how.</a></p> <p>You can also put in your Perl program: </p> <pre><code>use lib '/usr/lib/mymodules/'; # Appends path to @INC at compile time. use Devel::Cover; </code></pre>
