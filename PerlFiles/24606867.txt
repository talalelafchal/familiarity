Replace a line in PERL with other line
<p>I am iterating a file then there is a string for which I have to search for and from that string I have to replace a sub string with another string. Can anyone help me to solve this problem. I tried like this. </p> <pre><code>while(&lt;FH&gt;) { if($_ =~ /AndroidAPIEventLogging=false/i) { if($&amp; =~ s/false/True/) { print("Changed successfully\n"); } } } </code></pre> <p>Now it is showing that it can perform only read operations. I tried by opening the file in each possible mode. </p>
<p>You can do that using <a href="http://perldoc.perl.org/perlrun.html" rel="nofollow">-i option</a> via Perl one-liner</p> <pre><code>perl -i -pe 's/AndroidAPIEventLogging=false/AndroidAPIEventLogging=true/i' file1 file2... </code></pre> <p>As an alternative way, take a look at <a href="http://perldoc.perl.org/Tie/File.html" rel="nofollow">Tie::File</a>. It seems to be designed for quick in-place file edits.</p>
<p>Match and substitute is some kind of perl anti-pattern, as you're matching (often same strings) two times, so back to your question</p> <pre><code>while (&lt;FH&gt;) { # everything before '\K' is not replaced (positive look behind) if (s/AndroidAPIEventLogging=\Kfalse/True/i) { # $_ =~ print("Changed successfully\n"); } } </code></pre>
