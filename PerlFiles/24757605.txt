How can $^E be compared with a number?
<p>In <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/a/3220688/180275">http://stackoverflow.com/a/3220688/180275</a> the answer suggests that (after an <code>open</code>) <code>$^E</code> can be compared with <em>0x20</em> to determine if a file is being used by another process:</p> <pre><code>open ($fh, "&lt;", "the-file"); if ($^E == 0x20) { ... } </code></pre> <p>I have tried that and it works. <em>However</em>, if I print the value of <code>$^E</code> I get a string (<code>The process cannot access the file because it is being used by another process</code>).</p> <p>How then is the comparison to a number still possible?</p> <p>This is on Windows.</p>
<pre><code>&gt;perl -E"open my $fh, '&lt;', 'nonexistent'; say 0+$^E; say ''.$^E;" 2 The system cannot find the file specified </code></pre> <p>Like <code>$!</code>, <code>$^E</code> is a dualvar, a scalar that contains two values. One's a string, and one's a number.</p> <pre><code>&gt;perl -E"say $^E = 0x20;" The process cannot access the file because it is being used by another process </code></pre>
