Bash: cannot execute a perl script using an absolute path?
<p>problem: I cannot run a perl script using an absolute path. I can list it with the same path, but only execute it when using a relative path!</p> <p>the output of my Cygwin terminal will make this problem obvious</p> <p>Here I try to execute the script with an absolute path - it fails:</p> <pre><code>LPI@Reboot /cygdrive/c/Users $ /cygdrive/c/Users/LPI/3DSiteSoftware/Code/Scripts/path_name.pl Can't open perl script "/cygdrive/c/Users/LPI/3DSiteSoftware/Code/Scripts/path_name.pl": No such file or directory </code></pre> <p>Here I list it using the same absolute path - it works, the file is there:</p> <pre><code>LPI@Reboot /cygdrive/c/Users $ ls /cygdrive/c/Users/LPI/3DSiteSoftware/Code/Scripts/path_name.pl /cygdrive/c/Users/LPI/3DSiteSoftware/Code/Scripts/path_name.pl </code></pre> <p>Here I try and execute it using a path relative to my current directory /cygdrive/c/Users:</p> <pre><code>LPI@Reboot /cygdrive/c/Users $ LPI/3DSiteSoftware/Code/Scripts/path_name.pl USAGE: LPI/3DSiteSoftware/Code/Scripts/path_name.pl -p|-n &lt;string&gt; </code></pre> <p>Does anyone know why the first example is not working? I'm getting stumped! thanks for any advice.</p>
<p>I'm going to guess that you're using a non-Cygwin version of Perl (like Strawberry Perl or ActivePerl) that doesn't know anything about <code>/cygdrive/</code> paths. You can confirm this by running <code>perl -v</code>. If it says <code>built for MSWin32</code> then it's not Cygwin Perl.</p> <p>So when you run</p> <pre><code>/cygdrive/c/Users/LPI/3DSiteSoftware/Code/Scripts/path_name.pl </code></pre> <p>Bash runs</p> <pre><code>perl.exe /cygdrive/c/Users/LPI/3DSiteSoftware/Code/Scripts/path_name.pl </code></pre> <p>but Perl looks for</p> <pre><code>C:/cygdrive/c/Users/LPI/3DSiteSoftware/Code/Scripts/path_name.pl </code></pre> <p>and doesn't find it.</p> <p>When you run</p> <pre><code>LPI/3DSiteSoftware/Code/Scripts/path_name.pl </code></pre> <p>Bash runs</p> <pre><code>perl.exe LPI/3DSiteSoftware/Code/Scripts/path_name.pl </code></pre> <p>Perl combines that with your current directory of <code>C:\Users</code>, and gets</p> <pre><code>C:\Users\LPI/3DSiteSoftware/Code/Scripts/path_name.pl </code></pre> <p>(Perl doesn't care about mixed slashes on Windows).</p> <p>The simplest solution is probably just to install Cygwin's version of Perl, which will understand Cygwin paths. Or you could write some sort of shim <code>perl</code> that converts the script name to a Windows path and invokes the real <code>perl.exe</code>.</p> <p>Another possibility might be to use <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NTFS_symbolic_link" rel="nofollow">NTFS symbolic links</a> to create the <code>/cygdrive</code> directory on each of your volumes (i.e., create a <code>C:\cygdrive</code> directory, and make <code>C:\cygdrive\c</code> a symlink to <code>C:\</code>, <code>C:\cygdrive\d</code> a symlink to <code>D:\</code>, etc.). But you'd have to do that on any drive that might be current when you invoke a Perl script.</p>
