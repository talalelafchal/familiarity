perl Imager::File::PNG. Why does the install fail to find my libpng installed via MacPorts?
<p>I have installed libpng via MacPorts. Check. I have install Imager via cpan install. During the install it fails to find the path to my libpng which I installed via MacPorts without any issues.</p> <p>This is the contents of <code>/usr/local/lib</code>:</p> <pre><code>libpng.3.dylib* libpng.3.dylib.dSYM/ libpng12.0.dylib* libpng12.0.dylib.dSYM/ libpng12.a libpng12.la* libpng14.14.dylib* libpng14.14.dylib.dSYM/ libpng14.a libpng14.la* libpng15.15.dylib* libpng15.15.dylib.dSYM/ libpng15.a libpng15.la* </code></pre> <p>What have I missed?</p> <p>UPDATE - I am install on MacBook running Maverick (10.9.3) - Prior to Maverick installation my code worked fine</p> <p>Here is a blow by blow of my cpan install effort</p> <pre><code>cpan[1]&gt; force install Imager::File::PNG Reading '/Users/turner/.cpan/Metadata' Database was generated on Tue, 24 Jun 2014 13:17:02 GMT Running install for module 'Imager::File::PNG' Checksum for /Users/turner/.cpan/sources/authors/id/T/TO/TONYC/Imager-File-PNG-0.89.tar.gz ok Scanning cache /Users/turner/.cpan/build for sizes ............................................................................DONE Configuring T/TO/TONYC/Imager-File-PNG-0.89.tar.gz with Makefile.PL PNG: building independently PNG: Found via pkg-config libpng PNG: Test code failed: Can't link/include 'png15' PNG: v1.6: includes found - libraries found PNG: Test code failed: Can't link/include 'png16' PNG: v1.5: includes found - libraries found PNG: Test code failed: Can't link/include 'png15' PNG: v1.4: includes found - libraries found PNG: Test code failed: Can't link/include 'png14' PNG: v1.2: includes found - libraries found PNG: Test code failed: Can't link/include 'png12' PNG: v1.0: includes not found - libraries not found PNG: base (+libz): includes found - libraries found PNG: Test code failed: Can't link/include 'png', 'z' PNG: v1.6 (+libz): includes found - libraries found PNG: Test code failed: Can't link/include 'png16', 'z' PNG: v1.5 (+libz): includes found - libraries found PNG: Test code failed: Can't link/include 'png15', 'z' PNG: v1.4 (+libz): includes found - libraries found PNG: Test code failed: Can't link/include 'png14', 'z' PNG: v1.2 (+libz): includes found - libraries found PNG: Test code failed: Can't link/include 'png12', 'z' PNG: v1.0 (+libz): includes not found - libraries not found PNG: Checking if the compiler can find them on its own Warning (mostly harmless): No library found for -lpng PNG: Test code failed: Can't link/include 'png.h', 'stdio.h', 'png' OS unsupported: PNG libraries or headers not found Warning: No success on command[/usr/bin/perl Makefile.PL] TONYC/Imager-File-PNG-0.89.tar.gz /usr/bin/perl Makefile.PL -- NOT OK Failed during this command: TONYC/Imager-File-PNG-0.89.tar.gz : writemakefile NO '/usr/bin/perl Makefile.PL' returned status 512 </code></pre>
