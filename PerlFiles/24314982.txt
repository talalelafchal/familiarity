Use of uninitialized value in pattern match (m//) in some OS
<p>I'm getting the following error:</p> <p>"Use of uninitialized value in pattern match (m//)" regarding the code:</p> <pre><code>opendir DBASE, $dir or die "Problem: $!\n"; while (readdir (DBASE)) { if (/^\w*(?=\.com)/) { push @temp, $_; } } </code></pre> <p>When it's used in a Suse Linux Enterprise Server or IBM AIX (perl v5.8.8).</p> <p>But it works perfectly when I used it on Windows and FreeBSD (perl v5.18.2).</p> <p>I have read a lot of things and nothing worked, I'm just faithless now.</p> <p>NOTES: the variables $dir and @temp were declared before.</p> <p>Thanks in advance!</p>
