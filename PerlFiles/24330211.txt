Running a script on another html page without refreshing
<p>I'm trying to implement a notification system similar to Facebook's in that it will have a little icon in the header that when pressed, will drop down a div that has a bunch of the user's notifications sorted in a table. I want to then have the individual notifications to be marked as "read" on hover along with a "time_created" timestamp inserted into the database for that notification. Every notification on the table has its individual "notice_id". I'm using Perl on my page and lets call it main.html.</p> <p>I want to create another "readon.html" page that its sole purpose is to mark the notification as read since I have the individual notice_ids. I want to implement this where as soon as I hover over the notification in the drop down box in the header of the main.html it will perform these tasks without reloading the page. </p> <p>Is this possible? Or something similar? If so what should I look into and can you push me in the right direction. Thanks in advance. </p>
<p>How comfortable are you with jQuery and its AJAX implementation?</p> <p>Sounds like you need <code>jQuery.post()</code> <a href="http://api.jquery.com/jquery.post/" rel="nofollow">http://api.jquery.com/jquery.post/</a></p> <p><code>&lt;div class="notification unread" data-noticeid="123"&gt;Lorem ipsum&lt;/div&gt;</code></p> <pre><code>$(document).on('mouseenter', '.notification.unread', function(){ $(this).removeClass('unread'); var notice_id = $(this).data('noticeid'); $.post('readon.html', {notice_id: notice_id}); }); </code></pre> <p>Your Perl script at readon.html will then grab the <code>notice_id</code> and use the current server time to mark it as "read" on the backend.</p>
