Retrieve the username which got authenticated by the apache
<p>I have an apache 2.2 setup with LDAP auth enabled. The html form in the front end takes some values and processes them using perl script in the background. Is there a way I can get the username which is submitting the values in that perl script. I am planning to track who is doing what(with the values they submit) in a more better way in a file than the usual access_log.</p> <p>I tried using the below in my perl script, but no luck. Any help would be much appreciated.</p> <pre><code>my $userId = $_SERVER['AUTHENTICATE_SAMACCOUNTNAME']; print " I am $userId"; </code></pre>
<p>You appear to be confusing Perl with PHP :-)</p> <p>The usual way for a CGI program to get hold of the authenticated username, is though <code>$ENV{REMOTE_USER}</code>. But your reference to AUTHENTICATE_SAMACCOUNTNAME confuses me slightly. You might try <code>$ENV{AUTHENTICATE_SAMACCOUNTNAME}</code>.</p>
