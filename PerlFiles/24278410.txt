perl Net::FTP ls no matches
<pre><code>my $u = URI-&gt;new('ftp://myuri'); my $ftp = Net::FTP-&gt;new($u-&gt;host(), Debug =&gt; 1) or die "Connection failed!"; $ftp-&gt;login($u-&gt;user(), $u-&gt;password()) or die "Login failed!"; $ftp-&gt;cwd($u-&gt;path()) or die "CWD failed!"; $ftp-&gt;binary(); my @ls = $ftp-&gt;ls('S*.txt') or die "LIST failed!" . $ftp-&gt;code(); foreach $line (@ls) { print "### $line\n"; } </code></pre> <p>This code will die bacause ls has not any matches, it is possile to determine if ls() was successful but with no matches or there was other error?</p>
<p>Net::FTP is derived from Net::Cmd, so you should look into the documentation of Net::Cmd too. There you can see, that <code>$ftp-&gt;ok</code> can be used to check if the last command was ok even if it returned no data.</p>
