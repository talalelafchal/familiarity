How to get/put files from SFTP server using Net::SSH::Perl module?
<p>It might be simple query, but still I'm not clear regarding this.</p> <p>In my script I'm connecting to SFTP client server using <a href="https://metacpan.org/pod/Net%3a%3aSSH%3a%3aPerl" rel="nofollow"><code>Net::SSH::Perl</code></a> module. Previously I was using <a href="https://metacpan.org/pod/Net%3a%3aSFTP" rel="nofollow"><code>Net::SFTP</code></a> but removed from the script, as all of a sudden it stopped working and throwing an error.</p> <p>When I used <code>Net::SFTP</code>, most often I will use the below command to Put/get files from remote server.</p> <pre><code>$sftp-&gt;put("/home/ftpford/ftpcon/conout/$file","/Uti_Integrator/READYFORPICKUP/PENDING/$file"); </code></pre> <p>But I'm not sure of how to get/put files using <code>Net::SSH::Perl</code>. Can any one suggest? I have tried many ways and even I tried to search in Google but I'm not clear of any thing.</p> <p>And please note that I don't have privileges to install new modules in my server. I want to get/put files using the above Module.</p>
<p>I don't think that's a standard feature of Net::SSH::Perl.</p> <p>One option is to use other modules that do (you don't necessarily need to install them in the system directories, you can have them in your own directories if you include them via <code>PERL5LIB</code> or <code>use lib</code>.</p> <p>The other option (which answers your question <em>stricto sensu</em>) is to emulate it. You can try to simply run <code>cat &gt;$destination_file</code> on the remote box via Net::SSH::Perl, and then send the contents of the file over the ssh connection.</p> <p>Of course, error handling and the like might not be very straightforward...</p> <p>BTW, you tell us you have tried many things, but you don't tell us which, and what problems you encountered.</p>
