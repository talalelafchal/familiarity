Forward fastcgi STDERR to nginx error log
<p>I'm using nginx with a <a href="http://nginxlibrary.com/downloads/perl-fcgi/fastcgi-wrapper" rel="nofollow">fastcgi-wrapper</a> from <a href="http://nginxlibrary.com/perl-fastcgi/" rel="nofollow">http://nginxlibrary.com/perl-fastcgi/</a> to execute perl files on ubuntu 14.04. My problem is that whenever an error occurs in the perl file, the nginx error log contains no descriptive insides (unlike Apache). There is only a generic error like "upstream prematurely closed FastCGI stdout while reading response header from upstream". </p> <p>I assume that STDERR is not forwarded properly but I couldn't find any hint how to configure the wrapper in order to get it working as desired. Does anyone has some ideas for me?</p>
