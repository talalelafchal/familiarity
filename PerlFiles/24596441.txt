Not installed or installed?
<p>I have a problem in installing modules CPAN on my pc. I wanted to install a module from CPAN and the problem is ... If i do that command : <code>perl -MCPAN -e 'install XML::DT'</code> The answer is : <code>XML::DT is up to date (0.63).</code> But when i try to run my program with the module XML::DT, it tells me that i don't have installed ! So... What options do i have to solve this? </p> <p>Error given to me is : </p> <pre><code>Can't locate XML/DT.pm in @INC (@INC contains: /Library/Perl/5.16/darwin-thread-multi-2level /Library/Perl/5.16 /Network/Library/Perl/5.16/darwin-thread-multi-2level /Network/Library/Perl/5.16 /Library/Perl/Updates/5.16.2 /System/Library/Perl/5.16/darwin-thread-multi-2level /System/Library/Perl/5.16 /System/Library/Perl/Extras/5.16/darwin-thread-multi-2level /System/Library/Perl/Extras/5.16 .) at ./EX.pl line 2.
