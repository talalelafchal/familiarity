Printing words with capital letters in perl using regex
<p>I tried to make an algorithm in Perl to print only words with only the first letter being a capital letter. For the example:</p> <pre><code>Hey now Brown cow </code></pre> <p>It should print:</p> <pre><code>Hey Brown </code></pre> <p>But it is printing:</p> <pre><code>Hey Brown cow </code></pre> <p>Here is my code:</p> <pre><code>while (&lt;&gt;) { if (/^[A-Z][a-z]+/) { print; } } print "\n" </code></pre>
<p>Your regex suggests capital words at the beginning of the line. It also suggests you don't consider <code>I</code> a word. Given the characters you are interested in, you could fix that using -</p> <p><code>/^[A-Z](?i:[a-z])*/m and print $&amp;,"\n";</code> </p> <p>I put the multi-line modifier in because I can't tell what you're using for a line delimiter.</p>
<p>The following should work:</p> <pre><code>while ( /\b([A-Z][a-z]*)\b/g ) { print $1 . $/; } </code></pre> <p>Starting from the beginning of a word boundary (<code>\b</code>), we require at exactly one uppercase letter (<code>[A-Z]</code>). To finish off the word, we allow any number of lowercase letters (<code>[a-z]*</code>) until we reach the end of word (<code>\b</code>).</p> <p><a href="http://regexpal.com/?flags=g&amp;regex=%5Cb%28%5BA-Z%5D%5Ba-z%5D%2a%29%5Cb&amp;input=Hey%0Anow%0ABrown%20cow%0ADOESNTWORK%0Adoesn%27t%20work%0ANumb3rs%0AWorks" rel="nofollow">Here's a working example.</a></p>
<p>You're currently printing lines that begin with a capital word.</p> <p>To print words, you'll need to adjust your regex to either capture words:</p> <pre><code>while (&lt;&gt;) { while (/\b([A-Z][a-z]+)/g) { print $1, "\n"; } } </code></pre> <p>Or separate words to begin with and then filter out the capital ones:</p> <pre><code>while (&lt;&gt;) { for (grep /^[A-Z]/, split) { print $_, "\n"; } } </code></pre>
<p>Your regex is not lying to you. It matches a capitalized word, but then you go ahead and print the whole line.</p> <p>If you want to print only words that match, then the following should work: </p> <pre><code>my @words; while (&lt;&gt;) { @words = split(/\s+/); foreach my $word (@words) { print if (/^[A-Z][a-z]+/); } } </code></pre>
