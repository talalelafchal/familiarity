How to relate images in a folder to its metadata stored in mysql in perl?
<p>I am able to store the uploaded image in a folder(named by its category) and its related data like the uploaders info,its category in mysql using the code below.</p> <pre><code>use strict; use warnings; use DBI; use DBD::mysql; use CGI; $query = new CGI; $uploader_name = $query-&gt;param("name"); $filename = $query-&gt;param("file"); $category = $query-&gt;param("cat"); $uploaded_dir = $category; print $query-&gt;header(); $filename =~ s/.*[\/\\](.*)/$1/; $filename =~ s/ /_/g; $upload_filehandle = $query-&gt;upload("file"); $directory_filename = "$upload_dir/$filename"; # upload the file to the server open UPLOADFILE, "&gt;$directory_filename"; binmode UPLOADFILE; while ( &lt;$upload_filehandle&gt; ) { print UPLOADFILE; } close UPLOADFILE; # Open the file # open MYFILE, $directory_filename || print "Cannot open file"; # my $blob_file; # Read in the contents # while (&lt;MYFILE&gt;) # { # $blob_file .= $_; # } # close MYFILE; # make the database connection my $dbh=DBI-&gt;connect("DBI:mysql:database=pics;host=localhost","?","?"); # set the value of your SQL query $query = "insert into pic(uploader_name, category) values (?, ?) "; $sth = $dbh-&gt;prepare($query); $sth-&gt;execute($uploader_name, $category) || print "Can't access database"; $sth-&gt;finish; $dbh-&gt;disconnect; </code></pre> <p>I need the remaining metadata like its color, title etc of the loaded images.How can it be done? I heard of metadata extractors(in java) for this.How do they work. Suggest the best of them. Moreover how to relate an image with its respective metadata for retrieval?</p>
<p>just make "filename" a column in the DB table, and then you can find the rest of the data by file name.</p>
