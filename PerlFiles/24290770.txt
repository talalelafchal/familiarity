Perl SOAP::Lite server
<p>I've created the following SOAP::Lite server in Perl:</p> <pre><code>use SOAP::Transport::HTTP; SOAP::Transport::HTTP::CGI -&gt; dispatch_to('Test') -&gt; handle; package Test; sub Calculate { ... } </code></pre> <p>I then created a perl client to test the webservice and all went well. But I had to create a WSDL file with information about this SOAP web service. When I tested the WSDL file in a generic online SOAP client (<a href="http://www.soapclient.com/soaptest.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.soapclient.com/soaptest.html</a>) I started to get some errors, regarding the execution of the method Calculate, so I forced the use of this method using:</p> <pre><code>SOAP::Transport::HTTP::CGI -&gt; dispatch_to('Test') -&gt; on_action(sub { ($first, $second, $third) = @_; print $third; } -&gt; handle; </code></pre> <p>But now I'm getting the following error:</p> <pre><code>Denied access to method (Calculate) in class (main) </code></pre> <p>Any help would be appreciated.</p>
