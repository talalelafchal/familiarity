How to use &quot;say&quot; in Perl onelines without declaring 'use v5.11' or similar?
<p>In newer Perls there is "say" command that behaves like println:</p> <pre><code>$ perl -e 'use v5.11; say "qqq"' qqq </code></pre> <p>but it's a bit cumbersome to use in oneliners, as one needs to declare version...</p> <pre><code>$ perl -e 'say "qqq"' String found where operator expected at -e line 1, near "say "qqq"" $ perl -e 'print "qqq\n"' qqq # but \n is easy for forget and "print" is longer... </code></pre> <p>Is there a way to enable <code>say</code> without adding slashes (there can already by plenty of in the line) or moving cursor left to type <code>use v5.11</code> in command line?</p>
<p>If calling perl from the command line, you can use the <code>-E</code> flag</p> <ul> <li><code>-E program</code>: like <code>-e</code>, but enables all optional features</li> </ul> <p>As demonstrated:</p> <pre><code>$ perl -E 'say "qqq"' qqq </code></pre>
<p>As an option to <code>-E</code>, I use <code>-l</code>, which makes <code>print</code> work like <code>say</code> (add a newline). I use this most of the time myself, and I find that it completely replaces <code>say</code>.</p> <pre><code>$ perl -lwe'print "foo"' foo </code></pre> <p>What it really does is set <code>$\</code> to the current value of <code>$/</code>, which causes the oddity that the command line option <code>-0</code> affects <code>-l</code>, which is something to look out for. The order of the switches matter, so that </p> <pre><code>$ perl -l -00 -e'print "hi"' </code></pre> <p>works as expected, but</p> <pre><code>$ perl -00 -l -e'print "hi"' </code></pre> <p>Does not (it sets <code>$\</code> to <code>"\n\n"</code>, for paragraph mode).</p> <p>This latter case is practical when using paragraph mode, for re-printing the paragraphs easily. All in all, there are many benefits to using <code>-l</code>.</p> <p>Technically, <code>print</code> is longer than <code>say</code>, but my fingers already type <code>print</code> automatically, and <code>print</code> is in the actual case shorter than <code>print^H^H^H^H^Hsay</code>.. (backspace that is)</p>
