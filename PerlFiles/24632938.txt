When I was installing DBD:mysql for perl, an error came out
<p>I want to learn perl, and set up a Mysql database in my little Mac. I tried to install <code>DBD:mysql</code>, an error came when I type <code>make</code>.</p> <pre><code>In file included from /System/Library/Perl/Extras/5.16/darwin-thread-multi-2level/auto/DBI/DBIXS.h:23: /System/Library/Perl/5.16/darwin-thread-multi-2level/CORE/perl.h:610:11: fatal error: 'sys/types.h' file not found # include &lt;sys/types.h&gt; </code></pre> <p>I tried to googling it for days and no goals, please help me.</p>
<p>Typically <code>&lt;sys/types.h&gt;</code> means <code>/usr/include/sys/types.h</code>. </p> <p>If your system has '<code>locate</code>' installed, you could try </p> <pre><code> $ locate types.h </code></pre> <p>and see what it says. </p> <p>Otherwise something like:</p> <pre><code> $ find / -name 'types.h' -print | less </code></pre> <p>might take a while to run. But will show you where files named types.h live.</p> <p>If sys/types.h lives in a non-standard place, you can set CFLAGS environment variable [per the link that @ThisSuitIsBlackNot posted above] to tell the compiler to look in additional directories when searching for include files. </p>
