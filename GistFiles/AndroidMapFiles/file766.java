/**
 * <p>
 * Concrete extensions of this class are capable of rendering a multiplicity of
 * Views on background threads. Interrupting the rendering of a View to start a
 * new rendering is handled by this class. So too is rendering a view in
 * multiple passes (initial passes are automatically prioritized over subsequent
 * passes). Support for caching renderings is also available.
 * <p>
 * 
 * <p>
 * This class is mainly intended to be used within
 * {@link Adapter#getView(int, View, android.view.ViewGroup)} to handle all
 * aspects of the asynchronous rendering of the views within an associated
 * {@link AdapterView}.
 * </p>
 * 
 * <p>
 * Example: A simple scenario would be a {@link GridView} containing
 * {@link ImageView}s which are rendered by an instance of this class where
 * <code>Param<code> is {@link Uri} and <code>Render</code> is {@link Bitmap}
 * and the implementation loads bitmaps over HTTP for display in the view. The
 * {@link GridView} would invoke the {@link ViewRenderer} via an {@link Adapter}
 * that called the {@link #renderView(View, Object)} method on each call to its
 * {@link Adapter#getView(int, View, android.view.ViewGroup)} method. Such an
 * implementation might support two pass rendering, loading a low-res image on
 * the first pass before loading a high-res image later.
 * </p>
 * 
 * <p>
 * <strong>Note that this class requires a well defined equals method on the
 * class that satisfies Param.</strong>
