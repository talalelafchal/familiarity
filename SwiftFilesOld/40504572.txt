Enable Application badge from push notification iOS Swift Xcode 7.3
I have a LoginViewController and HomeViewController, in my appdelegate didFinishLaunchingWithOptions i have let settings = UIUserNotificationSettings(forTypes: [.Alert, .Badge, .Sound], categories: nil) application.registerUserNotificationSettings(settings) application.registerForRemoteNotifications() it asks when the user launch for first time i.e in login page it recieves push notification and updates icon badge number, I need to ask user permission in home page i.e after login success, so I moved the above code to homeviewController viewDidLoad(), it asks for user permission it recieves push notification and local variable is incremented, but the application badge number is not showing, if I move the code to appdelegate didFinishLaunchingWithOptions it works fine. i update badgenumber by didReceiveRemoteNotification application.applicationIconBadgeNumber = application.applicationIconBadgeNumber + 1 and i reset the badge number in applicationDidBecomeActive
