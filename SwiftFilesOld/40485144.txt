popToRootViewController not working when sending from add screen
I have a simple app I am building. A list of items in 1 view controller with a table view and embedded navigation controller. When you select a row it brings you to the details screen (no problem). Push from List View to List Item func tableView(_ tableView: UITableView, didSelectRowAt indexPath: IndexPath) { performSegue(withIdentifier: "ListItemDetailsVC", sender: nil) } Pop back from list item to List View @IBAction func backToInboxTapped(_ sender: Any) { navigationController?.popToRootViewController(animated: true) } This works fine! My issue is that I have another view controller (add item) that presents modally when add button is clicked. The idea is that when it saves it brings you to the list detail vc. @IBAction func saveItem(_ sender: Any) { performSegue(withIdentifier: "DetailsFromAdd", sender: nil) } Opening up the details view controller from the add new controller works fine but once I open the details view I want to be able to go back to the rootViewController. The button does not work anymore
Firstly, As you say that addVC is modally presenting so make sure addVC have some navigation otherwise you'll not able to push listItemVC from addVC. Now second thing, when you're modally presenting addVC then push listItemVC pushed from addVC, now addVC navigation controller have two view controllers. When you call navigationController?.popToRootViewController(animated: true) this will bring you to addVC because is being presented thats's why you will not able to see listVC. To solve this you've to add some dismiss presented view controller whenever you'll arrive at addVC.
In your case you should not need to use segue. You have to clear some concepts. You can't popToRootViewController or VC if you have pushed or show view controller from modally presented vc!! Now if you want to achieve this then you have to make some changes that I am trying to mention below : take one global variable or property (objective c concept) in your add item VC. now when you come to add item VC from lust VC set this global variable or property to self something like,  AddListItemVC *advc = [self.storyboard instantiateViewControllerWithIdentifier:@"addListItem"]; // addListItem is storyboard id for viewcontroller [self presentViewController:advc animated:NO completion:^{ advc.vc = self; // here vc is the propery of type `UIVIewController` declare in AddListItemVC }]; Now your code for going to details VC from add list VC should be like,  DetailListViewController *dvc = [self.storyboard instantiateViewControllerWithIdentifier:@"detailViewScreen"]; // detailViewScreen is storyboard id which you can set from identity inspector [self dismissViewControllerAnimated:NO completion:^{ [self.vc.navigationController pushViewController:dvc animated:YES]; // here self.vc is global variable or property that contains reference of first VC (i.e. list view controller) }]; no need to use performsegue in this case. You can use performsegue to go in detailvc directly from firstvc i mean from list vc. Hope you got understand concept and i have written objective c snippet because of lake of time!! hope you can easily convert to swift!!
