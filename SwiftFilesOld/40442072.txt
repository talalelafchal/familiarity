iOS: GooglePlaces API error
I am getting this error when trying to use the sample code from Google Places getting started Link Error: Current Place error: The operation couldnâ€™t be completed. An internal error occurred in the Places API library. I am calling this function on viewDidLoad. I also created a IBAction with this code to make sure it wasn't a timing issue. I got the same error this way as well. placesClient.currentPlace { (placeLikelihoods, error) in guard error == nil else { print("Current Place error: \(error!.localizedDescription)") return } if let placeLikelihoods = placeLikelihoods { for likelihood in placeLikelihoods.likelihoods { let place = likelihood.place print(place.name) } } } I have created a new project in Firebase, which created a new project in Google Dev Console. I created new API Key, Enabled Google Maps and Google Places API. I added CoreLocation framework, my pods are up to date. I should not be hitting any limits as it is just me learning. I have the Location When In Use set up i the Plist - user gets the dialog on fresh install. I accepted it. I added location manager code from here to make sure I am getting the location. I signed up for Apple developer to get the app on my device just in case the location wasn't staying on the simulator. I have a feeling this is something stupid. Please let me know any ideas to get passed this. Thanks!
