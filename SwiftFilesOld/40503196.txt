I try to view epub files using FolioReaderKit in Horizontal orientation. But, somehow when I try to view epub with video inside it throws error assertion failed: ERROR: Could not find table of contents resource. The book don't have a NCX resource. when displayed. I don't know what happen. my code is simple : let documentsPath = NSSearchPathForDirectoriesInDomains(.DocumentDirectory, .UserDomainMask, true)[0] let filePath = "/Users/developer/Documents/cc-shared-culture.epub" print(filePath) FolioReader.presentReader(parentViewController: self, withEpubPath: filePath, andConfig: config)
