How do I make an App-Store-esque buy button?
I am adding in app purchases to an app and I want to make purchase buttons similar to the iOS App Store buttons. It is a bit difficult to make the text look right within the button. This is what I have so far: let buyButton = UIButton(frame: CGRect(x: 0, y: 0, width: 64, height: 24)) buyButton.setTitle("$0.99", for: []) buyButton.layer.cornerRadius = 4 buyButton.layer.borderColor = UIColor.blue().cgColor buyButton.layer.borderWidth = 1 buyButton.setTitleColor(tintColor, for: []) buyButton.layer.backgroundColor = UIColor.clear.cgColor buyButton.titleLabel?.font = UIFont.systemFont(ofSize: 14) Does anyone know the correct size, corner radius, and font specs of the App Store buttons? I think the text is supposed to be a bit more bold. Here are some screenshot comparisons. Mine is the red one.
