Xcode 8.1 targets contain source code developed with an older version of swift
I'm using Xcode 8 and updating a project to swift 3. I am getting the following message when I open my workspace in Xcode 8.1. The targets “Alamofire” and “DBAlertController” contain source code developed with an earlier version of Swift. DerivedData mark$ pod --version 1.2.0.beta.1 I have emptied /Users/mark/Library/Developer/Xcode/DerivedData Podfile pod 'DBAlertController', :git => 'https://github.com/dbettermann/DBAlertController.git', :branch => 'swift3' pod 'Alamofire', '~> 4.0' Podfile source 'https://github.com/CocoaPods/Specs.git' platform :ios, '10.0' use_frameworks! I have also run pod update but did not fix it. Marks-Mac:mark$ cd /Users/mark/Library/Developer/Xcode/DerivedData Marks-Mac:DerivedData mark$ rm -rf * Marks-Mac:DerivedData mark$ cd Marks-Mac:~ mark$ cd Documents/myProject Marks-Mac:mark$ pod update Update all pods Updating local specs repositories Analyzing dependencies Pre-downloading: `DBAlertController` from `https://github.com/dbettermann/DBAlertController.git`, branch `swift3` Downloading dependencies Installing AFNetworking (3.1.0) Installing Alamofire (4.0.1) Installing DBAlertController (0.3.0)
Closed and opened Xcode and it seems to have fixed itself apart from a header file for AFNetworking not found..
