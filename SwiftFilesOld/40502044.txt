Swift How to present view in root navigation after dismiss modal
I'm trying to make ViewController present after Modal dismiss let storyboard = UIStoryboard(name: "Main", bundle: nil) let chatRoomVC = storyboard.instantiateViewController(withIdentifier: "ChatRoomVCId") as! ChatRoomVC chatRoomVC.hidesBottomBarWhenPushed = true chatRoomVC.passValue = passValue self.dismiss(animated: true, completion: { self.present(chatRoomVC, animated: true, completion: nil) }) But it will return "whose view is not in the window hierarchy!" maybe it's present a view after the controller dismissed
You are using self. It means you are dismissing the current view controller. It should be the parent view controller who will present a new view controller.
Notice the self in self.present, what you are doing, is basically tell the vc that you are dismissing to present a new vc, thats wrong way to do, the correct way is tell it's PARENT vc to present a new vc, by using delegate/unwind to call the parent vc to present new vc
