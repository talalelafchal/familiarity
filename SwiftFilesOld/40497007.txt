Swift 3 Array Declaration Benefits
When I learned Swift I always declared my arrays like so var myArrayDeclaration: [String] However in many tutorials and even in books released by Apple arrays are declared like so var appleArrayDeclaration = [String]() On the surface both appear to work exactly the same when I use them. Is there a reason why tutorials and Apple almost exclusively show the second method? Or is it developers preference?
The Second method use type inference, and its usually preferred by Apple and Developers since express the simplicity and expressiveness of swift 3 language optimization. Btw, both methods work and do the job!
