Spawning multiple of the same sprite in different locations
Currently I write all the code below for each sprite, when the only difference is the Y location. enemy1 = SKSpriteNode(texture: enemyTexture) enemy1.position = CGPoint(x: self.frame.midX - 300, y: self.frame.midY - 300) enemy1.physicsBody = SKPhysicsBody(texture: enemyTexture, size: enemyTexture.size()) enemy1.physicsBody!.affectedByGravity = false enemy1.physicsBody!.linearDamping = 0 enemy1.physicsBody!.allowsRotation = false enemy1.setScale(0.4) enemy1.physicsBody!.categoryBitMask = colliderType.enemy.rawValue enemy1.physicsBody!.contactTestBitMask = colliderType.player.rawValue enemy1.physicsBody!.collisionBitMask = colliderType.enemy.rawValue self.addChild(enemy1) I am also looking for a way to change their velocity. The velocity change would be the same for all the sprites. This is the code I use to the change their velocity: self.enemy1.physicsBody!.velocity = CGVector(dx: 300, dy: 0)
