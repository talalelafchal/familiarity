Swift3 - '[String : AnyObject]' is not convertible to '[HTTPCookiePropertyKey : Any]'
I'm just new to Swift and have taken over a project written in swift 2.2 with xCode 7.4. I am converting it to xCode 8 and swift3 and have only a single compiler error left. Please help to fix this. '[String : AnyObject]' is not convertible to '[HTTPCookiePropertyKey : Any]' Here is the offending line of code. let cookie = HTTPCookie(properties: dict as! [String : AnyObject] as! [HTTPCookiePropertyKey : Any]) Would this fix it? let cookie = HTTPCookie(properties: dict as! [HTTPCookiePropertyKey : Any])
AnyObject has been replaced with Any in Swift 3 for unspecified dictionary values. Since HTTPCookiePropertyKey is a type alias of (NS)String you can cast the type directly let cookie = HTTPCookie(properties: dict as! [HTTPCookiePropertyKey : Any]) Maybe even let cookie = HTTPCookie(properties: dict) could work.
