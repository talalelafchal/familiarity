How to return from IBAction into root Split View Controller into Master View Controller
I am having an issue with returning into root Split View Controller. I have a login page with a button on a separate View Controller and I want the user to return to Split View Controller after they login. The code that I have returns the user into root Split View Controller, however it takes him into empty Detail View controller. What change do I need to implement so the user is taken into Master View Controller with data?  @IBAction func goHome(sender: AnyObject) { let storyboard = UIStoryboard(name: "Main", bundle: nil) let splitViewController = storyboard.instantiateViewControllerWithIdentifier("SplitViewControllerID") as! UISplitViewController let appDelegate = UIApplication.sharedApplication().delegate as! AppDelegate appDelegate.window?.rootViewController = splitViewController }
You need to implement this method from UISplitViewControllerDelegate protocol:  func splitViewController(_ splitViewController: UISplitViewController, collapseSecondary secondaryViewController: UIViewController, onto primaryViewController: UIViewController) -> Bool { return true } When this method returns true, your master view controller will be shown by default.
