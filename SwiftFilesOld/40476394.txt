How start a animation in a certain time?
I have a CABasicAnimation involving multiple shapes that shows a transition between two different navigations. It's essentially a morph with an x duration. However, there are a couple of requirements that I don't know how to deal with (and my googlefu isn't helping) I need to be able to show an arbitrary point of the animation. For instance, if I'm mid-swipe between two views I need to be able to show the animation at 50%. I need to be able to start the animation at an arbitrary point. In the previous case, if I'm mid-swipe and release the view I need to be able to complete the animation from 50% to 100%. I gave it a shot with timeSincePause (code) but I can't get anywhere with the animation. As an aid I have these two methods, If the method of Resume an animation is an implicit way of continuing the same from a certain point with difference that is continuous from a time X which is defined by the pause method, how can I get it to NOT be the pause method that defines Continue beginTime if not already determined @IBAction func tapPause() { let pausetime = shape.convertTime(CACurrentMediaTime(), from: nil) shape.speed = 0.0 shape.timeOffset = pausetime } @IBAction func tapResume() { let pausedTime = shape.timeOffset shape.speed = 1.0 shape.timeOffset = 0.0 shape.beginTime = 0.0 let timeSincePause = shape.convertTime(CACurrentMediaTime(), from: nil) - pausetime shape.beginTime = timeSincePause } Which methods should I research to get this done?
