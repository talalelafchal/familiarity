How to change the position of a SCNode in SCNTransformationConstraint
Hey Im trying to basicly figure out how to position my "smallNode" alittle bit to the left of my "bigNode" with my SCNTransformConstraint. So basiclly the variable "newPosition" is the middle/center of the node called "bigNode". Were im having trouble is I would like to figure out how to maybe move the "newPosition" to not be at the center of the "bigNode" but maybe alittle to the left or right. because by default the "newPosition" variable puts the .transform location in the center of the bigNode. Usaully to set a node to a position compared to another node i would do somthing like this: Code: let newPosition = SCNVector3Make(bigNode.position.x + Float(3), bigNode.position.y + Float(13),bigNode.position.z + Float(4)) but obviously that doesnt work i think but below is my code im using Code:  let constraint = SCNTransformConstraint(inWorldSpace: true, withBlock:{ node, matrix in let newPosition = bigNode.transform return newPosition }) smallNode.constraints = [constraint] UPDATE: i was thinking maybe i could move my bigNodes "transform" position like this but idk. Code:  bigNode.transform = SCNMatrix4MakeTranslation(bigNode.position.x + 10, bigNode.position.y + 20, bigNode.position.z + 30)
