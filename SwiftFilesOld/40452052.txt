Overidde controlAlternatingRowBackgroundColors in Swift
I'm trying to figure out how to override controlAlternatingRowBackgroundColors in Swift but whatever I do I seem to get an error. extension NSColor { class var controlAlternatingRowBackgroundColors: [NSColor] { return [NSColor.red, NSColor.blue] } } This gives me "Getter for 'controlAlteratingRowBackgroundColors' with Objective-C selector 'controlAlteratingRowBackgroundColors' conflicts with previous delaration with the same Objective-C selector. If I use override then I get an error saying that it doesn't override anything. If I create a category on NSColor in objective c it all works as expected! Any ideas?
