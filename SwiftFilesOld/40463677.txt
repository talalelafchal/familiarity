adding uitextfield or (textentry box with keyboard) in sprite kit
I am recently working on sprite kit to create a simple game where user input name as identity and moves forward to play game and has option to edit name or replace name. Which is best option to use uitextfield: in skscene or viewcontroller? Or any other solutions? I had tried with uitextfield adding in skscene but got memory issue (since i called scene from viewwilllayoutSubview  override func viewWillLayoutSubviews() { let skView = self.view as! SKView skView.ignoresSiblingOrder = true let scene = NameEntryScene(size:CGSize(width: 1024, height: 718)) scene.scaleMode = .aspectFill skView.presentScene(scene) } which I followed stackoverflow others answer to add uitextfield in gamesence at didMove(to view: SKView). Also created uitextfield in viewcontroller and pass its instance all over the gamesence with action of isHidden true and false to remove memory issue, which worked but I can't work like this if i have many uitextfield's at various postions. Any suggestion and help is very much appreciated. Thanks in advance.
