Execute swift on Ubuntu
I have downloaded the official release of Swift for my Ubuntu (16.04). I would like to execute the file /path/to/swift/usr/bin/swift. I type ./swift in this directory and exec format error appears. Doesn't matter whether I run it directly (./) or change $PATH and type swift anywhere the same error appears. Is it a problem of Swift at all? Or is it the matter of my Ubuntu or this executable file? UPDATE: the exact error is: bash: /swift-3.0/usr/bin/swift: cannot execute binary file: Exec format error The file command reports: /swift-3.0/usr/bin/swift: ELF 64-bit LSB executable, x86-64, version 1 (SYSV), dynamically linked, interpreter /lib64/ld-linux-x86-64.so.2, for GNU/Linux 2.6.32, not stripped uname -a says: Linux Lenovo-B570 4.4.0-45-generic #66-Ubuntu SMP Wed Oct 19 14:12:05 UTC 2016 i686 i686 i686 GNU/Linux
Have a look at this tutorial for installing swift 3 from the Vapor framework docs. Try uninstalling swift and reinstalling using curl -sL swift.vapor.sh/ubuntu | bash from the link Note: The install script adds Swift to your ~/.bashrc profile automatically. You should be able to run swift files after running the above command. *Note: If this doesn't work then we can identify that the installation is not the issue.
You're trying to run a 64-bit executable (x86-64) on a 32-bit system (i686). That won't work (though you can usually do the reverse with a typical setup). You need to find and install a 32-bit version of Swift. (Or, if practical, consider updating your system to use a 64-bit OS.)
