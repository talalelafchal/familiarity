UserDefine Runtime Attributes doesn't work in Xcode8.0
It seems like xcode8.0 does not set the value of user runtime attributes when set from storyboard.What am trying to do is simple,set the label inside a cell as corneRadius of 10 which has width/height of 20. When i try to debug the views i got the following output which has weird width height(1000/1000..?) _UILabelLayer:0x600000283750; position = CGPoint (500 500); bounds = CGRect (0 0; 1000 1000); delegate = >; opaque = YES; allowsGroupOpacity = YES; cornerRadius = 10; contentsMultiplyColor = (null); rasterizationScale = 2; contentsScale = 2>
i think it's helpful for you. and also check the clipToBounds Checking "Clip Subviews" is equal to the code addMessageLabel.clipsToBounds = YES;
You can use this code and method on your controller  override func viewDidLayoutSubviews() { super.viewDidLayoutSubviews() yourLabel.clipsToBounds = true yourLabel.layoutIfNeeded() print("Frame ------> ",yourLabel.frame) }
