Swift - What is a good design decision for navigating through multiple scenes not using Tab Bar Controller?
I wanted to avoid using tab bar controller because it seems restrictive in where you can place your buttons to move on to another view/scene. What I was looking for: For example there is 4 scenes/views: A, B, C, D. All the 4 scenes have 3 buttons so that From scene A you can go to scene B or scene C or scene D. (When you click the appropriate button) From scene B you can go to scene A or scene C or scene D. From scene C you can go to scene A or scene B or scene D. From scene D you can go to scene A or scene B or scene C. I really wanted to avoid having 12 segues. The container view seems like it could be useful for what I'm doing, but I really wasn't able to find documentation for it. I tried putting the 4 buttons that navigate to A B C and D in a container, and have the 4 scenes/views embed that container. But I was also worried about performance because I am not popping the current view controller or popping to root view controller. Is there a proper way to do this? I'm relatively new to swift so the answer might be simple.
You could also have a rear view with all the pages, instead of a tab bar. I know it is not with buttons like you said, but it is how a lot of people have been doing. https://www.appcoda.com/sidebar-menu-swift/
As @Rodrigo Guimaraes stated a sidebar menu is a good choice, i've used it in projects. You could also think about using a UIPageViewController. PageViewControllers are used to display an array of ViewController's views. Then you will just need to set your UIButtons to navigate to the A, B, C, D viewcontroller in your pageview controller. This will also give your user the ability to swap from a->b->c->d and back again, Like turning the pages of a book or magazine.
