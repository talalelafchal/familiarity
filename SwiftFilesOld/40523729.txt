how to delete group data in swift
RightNow i have Dictionary.and i am adding to tableView.  let myArray = [["name": "First element", "foo": "bar","GroupID":"1"], ["name": "First element", "foo": "bar","GroupID":"1"],["name": "Second element", "foo": "bar","GroupID":"2"], ["name": "Second element", "foo": "bar","GroupID":"2"]] in this dictionary i have key GroupID. is it possible that i can get dictionary data whose GroupID = %@ i want to filter data based on grouping suppose i have four data. and group id is same in two data. i want to delete all data whose GroupID is same from dictionary if groupid == 1 than data will be deleted from dictionary whose GroupID == 1 and tableview will reload data. i am doing this because i want to delete group data. can you please help me?
Here is a simple way to do it: var index = 0 for element in myArray { if element["GroupID"] == "1" { myArray.remove(at: 0) index += 1 } else { index += 1 } } print(myArray): It prints out: [["name": "Second element", "GroupID": "2", "foo": "bar"], ["name": "Second element", "GroupID": "2", "foo": "bar"]] Good luck!
You can use filter on your Array to remove those dictionaries from your array, check this example var subitems: [[String:String]] = [ ["groupid": "1", "b": "2"], ["groupid": "3", "b": "4"], ["groupid": "1", "b": "6"] ] var filteredSubitems = subitems.filter{ $0["groupid"] != "1" // change with your groupid } print(filteredSubitems)
