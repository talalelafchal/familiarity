Preserving UITabBarController item's image color when item is disabled
I'm attempting to disable an item in my UITabBarController, however, I'd like to preserve the original icon's color when disabled, no alpha increase. I'm using Swift 3.0 and Xcode 8. I had hoped .withRenderingMode(.alwaysOriginal) would have done the trick, but it's not preserving the rendering for the disabled state.  let imageUnselectedClientSearch = #imageLiteral(resourceName: "warning") let imageSelectedClientSearch = #imageLiteral(resourceName: "warning") let clientSearchItem = self.tabBar.items?[mainTabBarIndex.clientSearch.rawValue] clientSearchItem?.selectedImage = imageSelectedClientSearch.withRenderingMode(.alwaysOriginal) clientSearchItem?.image = imageUnselectedClientSearch.withRenderingMode(.alwaysOriginal) clientSearchItem?.title = "Participant" clientSearchItem?.isEnabled = false
