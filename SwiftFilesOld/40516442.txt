Store date to firebase and query items in the last 24 hours
What's the best way to store dates into Firebase and be able to use query's with it? I hear that the best way to do it is to store it as time interval. if so, how would I query data stored in the last 24 hours?
Can someone confirm whether this is the right approach or not? Assuming that the data is as follows: "Items" { "-KWCwD8uqWyP9LrSkG3j" { "name": "Brush" "addedBy": "1478774386.282859" } } The swift code of getting time from the last 24 hours should look like this: let timeNow = Date().timeIntervalSince1970 let time24hoursBeforeNow = timeNow - 24 * 60 * 60 The query should look something like this: ref.child("Items").queryOrdered(byChild: "addedBy").queryStarting(atValue: timeNow).queryEnding(atValue: time24hoursBeforeNow)
