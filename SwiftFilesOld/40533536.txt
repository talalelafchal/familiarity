UIImagePicker source type doesn't want to change
I've set an UIImagePicker with a .savedPhotosAlbum as a sourcetype in order to develop an app. import UIKit class PictureViewController: UIViewController, UIImagePickerControllerDelegate, UINavigationControllerDelegate { /////////////////// OUTLETS //////////////////// ///////////////// PROPERTIES /////////////////// var imagePicker = UIImagePickerController() override func viewDidLoad() { super.viewDidLoad() imagePicker.delegate = self } func imagePickerController(_ picker: UIImagePickerController, didFinishPickingMediaWithInfo info: [String : Any]) { // Where do we want our photos from and we don't want edited photos imagePicker.allowsEditing = false imagePicker.sourceType = UIImagePickerControllerSourceType.camera imagePicker.cameraCaptureMode = .photo imagePicker.modalPresentationStyle = .fullScreen // Let's take the image from the picker let image = info[UIImagePickerControllerOriginalImage] as! UIImage snapImage.image = image // When the user picks a picture, disabling the background color of the UIImageView snapImage.backgroundColor = UIColor.clear // Closing the image picker imagePicker.dismiss(animated: true, completion: nil) } @IBAction func cameraTapped(_ sender: Any) { present(imagePicker, animated: true, completion: nil) } Now that my app is finished I want to try my app on my Iphone so I changed this : imagePicker.sourceType = .savedPhotosAlbum to imagePicker.sourceType = UIImagePickerControllerSourceType.camera And I have added in my info.plist <key>NSCameraUsageDescription</key> <string>We want to access your camera to ...</string> But when I try to take a picture, it keeps showing me my photos album and that is the problem. I want to be able to take a picture from the camera of my phone.
You need to put this code imagePicker.allowsEditing = false imagePicker.sourceType = UIImagePickerControllerSourceType.camera imagePicker.cameraCaptureMode = .photo imagePicker.modalPresentationStyle = .fullScreen in either viewDidLoad or cameraTapped Problem - As right now you are putting this code in the delegate method of UIImagePicker which gets called after either picking the image or taking the image.
