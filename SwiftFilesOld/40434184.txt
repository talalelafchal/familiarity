iOS Swift No Such File or Directory In Debug-iphoneos
Somebody please save me. This is the error I'm getting. I've tried cleaning, doing a build clean, pod installs and updates. I have not found a solution. Shell Script Invocation Error Group /Users/arthuraraujo/Library/Developer/Xcode/DerivedData/Anti-Social_Club-gizjofrkxroutxezxlbuadlvpwbo/Build/Products/Debug-iphoneos/Anti-Social: No such file or directory
I have similar issues in the past and doing the following work for me. Hope your problem is same as mine: Close xCode Go to this folder Group /Users/arthuraraujo/Library/Developer/Xcode/DerivedData/Anti-Social_Club-gizjofrkxroutxezxlbuadlvpwbo/Build/Products/Debug-iphoneos/ and delete Anti-Social. Restart xCode, clean & build.
It is hard to really tell you the solution with just the information provided. However, the first thing I would try is deleting the derived data, as CodeBender stated. You should also look at your search paths in your project's building settings to make sure your pods are correct/ connecting your pods files to your project.

Did "pod install" Opened xcode and cleaned project and deleted derivedData.
