Why does CGColor.copy() return an optional value?
So since the function CGColor.copy() returns an optional value, one would assume that there might be a reason for it to return nil. However I cannot think of any reason for this to fail other than if the CGColor itself is an optional value. Since I am using this in my program does anyone know a reason for this to return nil on a value that is not optional?
I think you've explained it correctly. Remember, there is really no such object as a CGColor; it doesn't actually have methods like copy. This is a hand-tweaked rendering of a global C function: CGColorRef CGColorCreateCopy(CGColorRef color); Well, a CGColorRef can always be nil, so color can be nil, so the result can be nil. So the result has to be an Optional. (It can't be sometimes an Optional and at other times not an Optional.)
