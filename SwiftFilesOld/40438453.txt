Failed to load info.plist bundle for Quickblox framework
We are using pod of Quickblox framework in app and we are facing below problem. Failed to load Info.plist from bundle at path /Users/SandeepApple/Library/Developer/CoreSimulator/Devices/55985961-C1EC-4102-BF08-2FFD1EE5BDD0/data/Library/Caches/com.apple.mobile.installd.staging/temp.JzPbI0/extracted/GigMates.app/Frameworks/Quickblox.framework
You have in the Bridging-Header.h this line: #import <Quickblox/Quickblox.h> If you use pods, you need 3 pods: pod 'QuickBlox' pod 'Fabric' pod 'Crashlytics'
