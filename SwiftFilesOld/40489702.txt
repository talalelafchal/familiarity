QMChatViewController resulting in &quot;Cannot assign to property: 'self' is immutable
I have an application which uses QuickBlox as a chat service. Everything I have builds including various QuickBlox services and session libraries. However, when I try to use QMChatViewController by simply importing it anywhere: import QMChatViewController these errors appear: self.imagePhoto.imageURL = NSURL(string: url) "Cannot assign to property: 'self' is immutable" and imageView.imageURL = NSURL(string: photoURL) "Cannot assign to property: 'imageView' is a 'let' constant" I think it has something to do with AsyncImageView but I've removed the pod and it's still happening. When the 'import QMChatViewController' line is removed, the project builds fine. Anyone familiar with 'self is immutable' build errors?
You can set a value to an immutable object by using "setValue" self.imageView.setValue(NSURL(string: photoURL), forKey: "imageURL")
