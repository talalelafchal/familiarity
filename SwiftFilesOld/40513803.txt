Google Places iOS: How to provide context to API for relevant local results
Using Google Places API for iOS, I am using the Place AutoComplete feature. When I start typing a place name for example 'Starbucks' it gives me starbucks location in several countries but not my local starbucks. How do I pass the current location to the API so the search results start from closest to my location?
You can pass a GMSCoordinateBounds to the which is "object biasing the results to a specific area specified by latitude and longitude bounds". They have an example on their site showing how to do this: let visibleRegion = self.mapView.projection.visibleRegion() let bounds = GMSCoordinateBounds(coordinate: visibleRegion.farLeft, coordinate: visibleRegion.nearRight) let filter = GMSAutocompleteFilter() filter.type = GMSPlacesAutocompleteTypeFilter.City placesClient.autocompleteQuery("Sydney Oper", bounds: bounds, filter: filter, callback: { (results, error: NSError?) -> Void in guard error == nil else { print("Autocomplete error \(error)") return } for result in results! { print("Result \(result.attributedFullText) with placeID \(result.placeID)") } }) This example show how to pull this data from a map view but you can also create the GMSCoordinateBounds manually. Hope this helps.
