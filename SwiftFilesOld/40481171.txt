iOS swift: How to get the UITextView of SLComposeViewController when using SLServiceTypeTwitter?
I'm trying to get the UITextView of SLComposeViewController with the following code in the completion handler but it does not seem to have one: for viewLayer1 in tweetDialog.view.subviews { print("viewlayer1 \(viewLayer1)") for viewLayer2 in viewLayer1.subviews { print("viewlayer2 \(viewLayer2)") if viewLayer2.isKind(of: UIView.self) { print(viewLayer2.subviews) for viewLayer3 in viewLayer2.subviews { print("viewlayer3 \(viewLayer3)") if viewLayer3.isKind(of: UITextView.self) { let view = viewLayer3 } } } } } The output of this loop is viewlayer1 <_UISizeTrackingView: 0x16dbb840; frame = (0 0; 320 568); autoresize = W+H; layer = <CALayer: 0x16f3e700>> viewlayer2 <_UIRemoteView: 0x16f38f60; frame = (0 0; 320 568); userInteractionEnabled = NO; layer = <CALayerHost: 0x16f3aa40>> [] The UIRemoteView has no subviews. How do you explain that? Does that mean the UITextView is not accessible?
