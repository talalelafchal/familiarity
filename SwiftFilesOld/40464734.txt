Three level multiple dynamic uitableview or accordion view
I am working on dynamic multilevel UITableView, in which Tableview is loaded with dynamic data. Inside it there are two static rows. These static rows are present below every dynamic cell. When we click at any of the static row, nsurl is called and data is loaded below the current opened row. Count of nsurl data received can be any. Again when we click on the row data got,another tableView is created below it with almost 17's row. I have seen multiple expanded cell examples as Accordion, TreeView but at last step I am getting problem. Please guide me how to make such a tableView and also share if any demo or sample anyone have. Thanks.
