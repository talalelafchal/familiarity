Swift ios unwind to root ViewController tab from anywhere
I have a tab based app. And I wonder if its possible to unwind the user from anywhere to the root of the current tab. My app is built like this: TabController -> (tabs) -> navigationController -> vc etc.. So lets say that I press on tab 4 in my app. Now I dig through two viewcontrollers and end up in a modal presented VC. Now I want to go back straight to the root of the tab: tab 4 -> navigationController -> rootVC -> pushVC -> pushVC -> modalVc So I eg from modalVc to rootVC I know that I can do something like this, BUT I want to go to the rootVC from any VC within tab4, and using that technique would force me to create a unwind segue on all of my child VCs in tab 4 I am using notifications and when a user press on the notification I want to take the user to the rootVC from anywhere. And using something like: let storyboard = UIStoryboard(name: "Main", bundle: nil) let destinationViewController = storyboard.instantiateViewController(withIdentifier: "accountVc") as? AccountViewController navInTab.pushViewController(destinationViewController!, animated: false) Does not work for eg: vc -> vc -> modalVc since it will mess up the navigationstack
You can pop to the root of a navigation stack, or pop to the nth element in the stack, or replace the stack of view controllers with a different stack. You can use popToRootViewController on the navigationController to go back to the very root of a navigation stack. Or suppose you want to go back to the first VC in the stack for example, you would do something like let controllerStack = self.navigationController?.viewControllers _ = self.navigationController?.popToViewController((controllerStack?[0])!, animated: true) Or you can replace the navigation stack of view controllers with a new stack of controllers i.e. NSMutableArray *controllerStack = [NSMutableArray arrayWithArray:navigationController.viewControllers]; // Replace the source controller with the destination controller, wherever the source may be [controllerStack replaceObjectAtIndex:[controllerStack indexOfObject:sourceViewController] withObject:destinationController]; // Assign the updated stack with animation [navigationController setViewControllers:controllerStack animated:YES];
