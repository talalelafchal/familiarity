Locating element in Xcode UI Test without accessiblity id
I am started learning XCode to write functional automation tests using UI testing feature of Xcode. I need to read a text value of native app element. I can get the element with the help of text of element but the problem is I can not use the text as it is dynamic it will be changed after some time or next launch of app. I am familiar with using WebDriver and Appium where I can tackle this with writing parent - child xpath. Can anyone suggest a solution to this problem? Please post a sample code snippet as well with your solution as I am new to apple technology / swift. Appreciate your help.
