Count occurrences of part key value in Dict (Swift)
Lets say I have a dict containing the following values and keys let dict = ["Foo" : 1, "FooBar" : 2, "Bar" : 3, "BarBar" : 4, "FooFoo" : 5 ] My question is :- How would one count the occurrences of the KEY containing or partly containing the key string "Foo" The result should be 3 ("Foo","FooBar","FooFoo" ) One direction I am looking at is using print( dict.keys .contains("Foo")) This of course returns true print( dict.keys .contains("Fo")) It will return a false value when in actual fact "Fo" occurs 3 times but only as a part key name. Hoping that makes sense :F So again how do I count the par key name occurrences in a given dictionary
A straightforward way is this: dict.filter{ $0.key.contains("Foo") }.count We leave all the keys that conatins "Foo" in the dictionary and count the number of KVPs left!
You need to filter the keys and then count them let arr = dict.keys.filter{ $0.contains("Fo") } print(arr.count)
