Swift conditional compilation access control
I am building an iOS framework and i need the same framework to be used in public apps and in some internal apps , the difference is that in the internal apps I need access to some classes and function that I want to hide from the public apps and i don't want to copy paste code from the framework to the internal apps ... Is it possible to use conditional compilation (or some other solution without duplicating code) to do something like : #if SOMEFLAG public #else internal #endif class SomeClass{ // public when SOMEFLAG otherwise internal } of course the code above is not working so it is the pseudo code for what i need ( it doesn't have to be with macros) . Thanks.
