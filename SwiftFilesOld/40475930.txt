Using navigation controller from the object does NOT work exactly as using it to embed in xcode
I'm having this issue where if I am developing an app using a navigation controller. The toolbar is being displayed in the storyboard perfectly when using the option Editor > Embed In from xcode. It means that if I create a segue from one view to another where the root was the one being embedded, every view controller in the storyboard is displaying the toolbar properly but if I try to using the navigation controller dragging from the bottom right objects (Navigation View Controller) and set the same root that was set before, the only view controller that displays the toolbar is the root one. Why is that happening and how can I use the navigation from the bottom right objects to handle the segues keeping the toolbars and the back button to function properly ? Thanks in advance
