XCode 8.1 crashes when I open .swift/.xib file
I had previously installed XCode 7.3 and updated it to 8.1 through the AppStore. When the project opened(XCode 8.1, Swift 3.0, Mac OS X El Capitan 10.11.6) I'm trying to open any file(.swift/.xib/.storyboard/.plist/.coredata etc.) the XCode just crashes. Here is the my Crash Log of XCode 8.1: https://gist.github.com/anonymous/339bffc7b67100ae5e82012393cb00bd
