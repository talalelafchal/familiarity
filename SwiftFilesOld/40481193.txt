App Suddenly Crash When Call Super.init(coder : aDecoder)
I am trying to add a subview in a viewController. To perform that I have created an xib file and an associated class. The code of the associated class is given below import UIKit @IBDesignable class CustomClassViewController: UIView { @IBOutlet weak var myLabel: UILabel! var Dummyview : UIView! //= UIView() override init(frame: CGRect) { super.init(frame: frame) setup() } required init (coder aDecoder : NSCoder){ super.init(coder : aDecoder)! setup() } func setup() { Dummyview = loadViewFromNib() Dummyview.frame = bounds Dummyview.autoresizingMask = UIViewAutoresizing.FlexibleWidth Dummyview.autoresizingMask = UIViewAutoresizing.FlexibleHeight addSubview(Dummyview) } func loadViewFromNib() -> UIView { let bundle = NSBundle(forClass : self.dynamicType) let nib = UINib(nibName: "Custom View", bundle: bundle) let view = nib.instantiateWithOwner(self, options: nil)[0] as! UIView return view } It shows no Error before run the application but it crash when I run the application. The Error shows in the below line telling that. "Threat 1: EXC_BAD_ACCESS(code= 2, address= 0x7fff52776e88)" super.init(coder : aDecoder)! But no Errors in Output. I have tried the solution provided in here and here but not worked. What should I do? Any solution? Please let me know. Thanks in advance
Init with coder can fail, you shouldn't use force unwrap there. Try the following: required init?(coder aDecoder: NSCoder) { super.init(coder: aDecoder) setup() } Also your class CustomClassViewController is a subclass of the UIView and not the UIViewController. Change this line @IBDesignable class CustomClassViewController: UIView { to class CustomClassViewController: UIViewController { Note: A view controller cannot be IBDesignable
