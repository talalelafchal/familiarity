AVAudio Player duration as CGFloat in Swift
I just read this article and there is no problem. But i can't assign that value to CGFloat(). In short, i'm using MarkRangeSlider and i need to assign left and right values as CGFloat. When i slide left or right thumb i want to show user label like ("1:20","2:30") not "1.80" Is there any idea? This is my code: player = try! AVAudioPlayer(contentsOf: songUrl as URL) let getSecs = player.duration let formatter = DateComponentsFormatter() formatter.unitsStyle = .positional formatter.allowedUnits = [.minute, .second] formatter.zeroFormattingBehavior = .pad if let formatted = formatter.string(from: getSecs) { print(formatted) } rangeSlider.setMinValue(CGFloat(minimumValue), maxValue: CGFloat(getSecs)) rangeSlider.setLeftValue(CGFloat(minimumValue), rightValue: CGFloat(getSecs)) Thank you all.
