Using Callkit to make a call where phone number not known
I am working on an app where I want to allow users to communicate by using a username and not to know the phone number. I am not certain how to approach this, as it seems that WebRTC isn't the best choice, but I don't want to have the server send the phone number to the phone as that means that the user can potentially get the phone number if they break the encryption. How do I make a phone call through Callkit and have it go through a server? I expect to encrypt the packets so the server can't decrypt.
You don't need to provide the Phone number to the callkit. Just provide the display name while you receive the call, this is the way skype works. On tap of Recents history, your app will get redirected, from that you can make the call again. This method get fired, - (BOOL)application:(UIApplication *)application continueUserActivity
