How to add a set of sprites in a certain pattern
I'm making a game that has a player that goes up and down if you hold the screen. This is not the important part though. What I need is to add ENEMIES, that come toward you. I need to know how to add the ENEMIES in a couple of different patterns. Like this:(LOOK AT THE COINS PATTERN, HOW CAN I ACHIEVE THIS?)
You could define a 2-dimensional array to indicate where a coin should be e.g. var coinRow = [[Int]]() coinRow.append([0,1,1,1,1,1,1,0]) // '0' means 'No coin here' coinRow.append([1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1]) // '1' means 'put coin here' coinRow.append([0,1,1,1,1,1,1,0]) Then treat each coin 'area' as a 3x8 grid so given a starting location of the bottom-left hand corner as (0,0), do the following: let coinStart = CGPoint(0,0) coinPos = coinStart for row in 0...2 { // Iterate over all rows for column in 0...7 { // and all columns if coinRow[row][column] == 1 { // Should there be a coin here? putCoin(at: coinPos) // yes - draw one } coinPos.x += coin.width + coinHorizontalSeparation // next coin location } coinPos.y += coin.height + coinVerticalSeparation // Position to next row coinPos.x = coinStart.x // Reset position to start of row } You wouldn't actually start at (0,0), so set coinStart as required. If the groups of coins appear in a regular pattern, then you can calculate coinStart and make the code that generates a block of coins a function that you call, passing coinStart as a parameter.
