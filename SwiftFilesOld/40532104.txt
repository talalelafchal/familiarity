How to cancel specific repeated UILocalNotification?
I schedule UILocalNotification with repeatInterval = every day, but i wanna cancel specific notification, for example notification on the day after tomorrow. Can i do that?
UILocalNotification* localNotification = [[UILocalNotification alloc] init]; localNotification.fireDate = [[NSDate date] dateByAddingTimeInterval:100]; localNotification.timeZone = [NSTimeZone defaultTimeZone]; localNotification.soundName = UILocalNotificationDefaultSoundName; [[UIApplication sharedApplication] scheduleLocalNotification:localNotification]; now list out all notification that you have added. -(void)localNotifcationList{ UIApplication *app = [UIApplication sharedApplication]; NSArray *eventArray = [app scheduledLocalNotifications]; for (int i=0; i<[eventArray count]; i++) { UILocalNotification* yourEventSequence = [eventArray objectAtIndex:i]; NSDictionary *userInfoCurrent = yourEventSequence.userInfo; NSString *uid=[NSString stringWithFormat:@"%@",[userInfoCurrent valueForKey:@"uid"]]; //Based on your userinfo cancel particular notification. // You can also compare fire date here } I hope this code will work.
Can i do that No. If this was configured as a repeating daily notification, you cannot magically remove one repetition from it. You would have to cancel the entire notification and reschedule starting the day after the day after tomorrow.
