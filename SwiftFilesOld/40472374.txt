Realm, avoid to store some property
I need to implement a protocol in my User model, which need to have some special properties. But I'd like to avoid them to be stored/persisted in Realm database. I didn't see in the documentation if there was a keyword for this. Did there is a trick to avoid saving some properties ? public final class User: Object, Mappable, AvatarImageViewDataSource { dynamic var id: Int = 0 dynamic var desc: String? = nil dynamic var email: String? = nil dynamic var firstName: String? = nil dynamic var lastName: String? = nil ... public var myPropertyIDontWantToSave: String? = nil // I don't want this to be stored
Check out the RealmSwift docs about Ignored properties. There's is some sample code: class Person: Object { dynamic var tmpID = 0 var name: String { // read-only properties are automatically ignored return "\(firstName) \(lastName)" } dynamic var firstName = "" dynamic var lastName = "" override static func ignoredProperties() -> [String] { return ["tmpID"] } }
