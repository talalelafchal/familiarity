Add array object not init
I have a method that init my class object from JSON. The method like this: func getList (dic : Array<[String:AnyObject]>) -> Array<Dog> { let dogs : NSMutableArray = NSMutableArray() for myDic in dic { let dog = Dog.init(dog: myDic) dogs.addObject(dog) } return NSArray(dogs) as! Array<Dog> } And I can present it on tableview without issue. But right now I want to make pagination for the list. If I run the method getList again it will be init new object and replacing my old one. How can I to add a new object to exisiting. I don't want to create separate object with the same property.
You need to add a member variable which you will append to. So: var dogs: [Dog] = [] And then call getList like this: dogs += getList(dic: myDic) By the way, you can make your getList method much simpler, like this: func getList(dic: [[String: AnyObject]]) -> [Dog] { return dic.map(Dog.init) }
