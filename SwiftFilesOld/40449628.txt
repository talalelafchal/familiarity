UIImageView doesn't animate when using Auto Layout
My image has the following constraints: leading = 0 trailing = 0 top = 75 height = 250 I want my image to start from the right side of the screen and move to initial place where the constraints are set. Here is my code: imageLeadingConstraint.constant = 100 imageTrailingConstraint.constant = -100 imageTopConstraint.constant = 100 image.layoutIfNeeded() UIView.animate(withDuration: 1.0) { self.imageLeadingConstraint.constant = 0 self.imageTrailingConstraint.constant = 0 self.imageTopConstraint.constant = 75 self.image.layoutIfNeeded() } The issue is that the image is moving to initial place, but not using an animation. Is my code right ? How come the image just appears in the new position and not animating ?
I'm not sure that I understood you, but: 1) Change constraints (second time) outside of animation block. 2) use self.image.superview?.layoutIfNeeded() instead
You should call layoutIfNeeded for imageView's superview. self.image.superview.layoutIfNeeded()
