How to Add Animations to Change SNCNode's Color SceneKit?
I would like to know how I can animate an SCNNode's color using Swift. For example: I would like the node to constantly be changing color or I would like the node to fade from black to blue. do I use the SCNAction fadeIn or fadeOut? Thanks in advance!
You can create a custom action. If you have a red sphere in your scene let sphereNode = scene.rootNode.childNode(withName: "sphere", recursively: false)! sphereNode.geometry!.firstMaterial!.diffuse.contents = UIColor.red This is how you build the custom action let changeColor = SCNAction.customAction(duration: 10) { (node, elapsedTime) -> () in let percentage = elapsedTime / 5 let color = UIColor(red: 1 - percentage, green: percentage, blue: 0, alpha: 1) node.geometry!.firstMaterial!.diffuse.contents = color } Finally you just need to run the action on the sphere sphereNode.runAction(changeColor) Result
