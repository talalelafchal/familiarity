Detect collision for particles and Wind effect
I'm looking to achieve this effect. I thought about making WIND PARTICLES and then when the player collides with it, force will be applied. But how can I check if the player collided with the WIND PARTICLES? If you have other suggestions about how this effect can be achieved I will be more than thankful!
Try this answer to simulate wind: How to create wind effect in spritekit I believe it will provide the force and effect that you need. You can also spawn particles and set them to be non-interactive to the player but which will visually show the wind effect.
You do not want to do the collision test with particles, You want to use the SKFieldNode to achieve this effect. https://developer.apple.com/reference/spritekit/skfieldnode I am not sure which one to use for the wind effect, but at least it will get you started on the right direction, but basically what it does is set up a "force field" and the node hits this force field, some kind of physics get applied to it.
