Leaks in Swift 3 / iOS 10
When I'm running instruments and check for leaks, it's showing leaks mainly consisting of: _ContiguousArrayStorage<String> _NativeDictionaryStorageOwner<Int, CGFloat> _NativeDictionaryStorageOwner<String, AnyObject> This is when I'm using Swift 3 and testing on devices using iOS 10. The leaks only show up in iOS 10 while on iOS 9.x everything seems to be normal. On top of that, in iOS 10 UISwitch doesn't seem to deallocate either. Currently I've been creating all kinds of workarounds trying to avoid using dictionaries and in some cases arrays, making it really annoying to code. Question: Should I be concerned about this and try to fix all these leaks or wait and hope it will be fixed in future updates? If so, is there anywhere to check about which bugs are known etc?
