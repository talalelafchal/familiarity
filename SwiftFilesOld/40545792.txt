Swift Regex &amp; Delimiters
I am parsing some HTML and parsing substrings. I have started by placing all parsed text from the elements into an array. Now I need to make functions that return an array of the substrings I need. Here is some data I need to parse (these are the most extreme cases of what the data I am working with will look like). let arr = [ "ABC 111-1 LOC (31245)", "TuTh 12:15PM - 1:30PM Something 101", "MATT 1456-1 LOC (1248)", "Sa 4:15PM - 7:15PM SomePlace 532", "AC G7700 LOC (1248)", "DATE: TBA " ] Each substring that is bolded is what I care about. Im creating a loop  for i in 0...arr.count - 1 { if i % 2 == 0 { let product = parseProduct[arr[i]] let delivery = parseSchedule[arr[i+1]] } } I need help creating the parseProduct and parseSchedule functions that return an array of the parse substrings. Final output of product array After first loop iteration, I would like this result product = ["ABC", "111-1", "31245"] delivery = ["TuTh", "12:15PM", "1:30PM", "Something", "101]
You can try those regexes .*?(?= LOC) matches from start of the string to LOC see here (?<=\().*?(?=\)) matches from a parenthesis to another, it will match the number in parenthesis see here .*(?= -) matches from the start of the string to -, it will match TuTh 12:15PM and similar see here (?<=- ).* matches the time 12:00PM, from - to the end of string see here DATE:.* matches DATE: and everything after see here. If you want to support lowercase date: too, use case insensitive i flag. Disclaimer: I'm not familiar with Swift and could not test with its regex engine so I used prep engine. Your engine might not support lookahead/behind and most of these regexes won't work. If these aren't what you searching, leave a comment and please add more information to your question: longer array, exceptions, is it case sensitive, what pattern each bolded substring follow, etc.
