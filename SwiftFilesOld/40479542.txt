Swift Compiler Error,Expression type 'Error' is ambiguous without more context
typealias SwiftAMapCompletion = (CLLocation?,AMapLocationReGeocode?,Error) -> Void var locationResult : SwiftAMapCompletion? I want to give a nil as Error, but "Swift Compiler Error" is Expression type 'Error' is ambiguous without more context.(SwiftAMapCompletion can't change) locationResult!(location, reGeocode, nil as! Error)
You cannot force nil to be an Error, not even if you use as!. Your options are: Change the declaration to be Error?, because that would mean that you can pass nil. Pass an Error. For example: enum MyError: Error { case ok } locationResult!(location, reGeocode, MyError.ok) In my opinion, your SwiftAMapCompletion interface does not make any sense, because normally a callback like this would be "here is the result, or here is the error" so all parameters should be declared as optional (with ?). I would get this interface changed if you can.
