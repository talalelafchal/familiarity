Having a CAShapeLayer as property causes leak
After noticing many leaks using Swift 3 and iOS 10 together I tried to reproduce one of the leaks. I noticed that having a CAShapeLayer as a property in a subclass of another subclass of UITableViewCell causes a leak. class BaseCell: UITableViewCell { } class TestCell: BaseCell { let customLayer = CAShapeLayer() // This causes a leak in instruments } Question: Can someone else confirm this is and more importantly, how can I fix this? Note: - This doesn't happen in iOS 9. - If the CAShapeLayer is a property of BaseCell no leak will occur. - Same leak shows up if CAShapeLayer is replaced by UIView.
