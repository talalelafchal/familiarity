Swift &amp; Parse Server Config: How to add a &quot;Message of the Day&quot; cell at the top of a tableview
Goal: I'm trying to add a dynamic "Message of the Day" kind of cell to the top of a UITableView in Swift using Parse Server Config. Similar to how you see a new cell at the top of your Facebook iOS app feed that's related to the current time/day (i.e.: "Good morning, SomeName" or "It's Election Day! Go Vote!"). See screenshot below for an example (the cell inside the red lines). What I've done: I've read the Parse Config iOS docs and have added a key/value pair (parameter) to the app on the Parse Config Dashboard. My code for retrieving the Parse Config: // Retrieving my Parse Config: PFConfig.getConfigInBackgroundWithBlock { (var config: PFConfig?, error: NSError?) -> Void in if error == nil { var message = config?["MessageOfTheDay"] as? NSString print("Today's message of the day: \(message)") } else { print("Failed to fetch. Using Cached Config.") config = PFConfig.currentConfig() } Now that I have the "Message of the Day", I need help please with adding a table view cell showing this message of the day. What I need help with: How to dynamically add a cell (with the text and/or image returned from the Parse Config to the top of the UITableView (at indexPath.row == 1) when I add a new "Message of the Day!" parameter in Parse Config Dashboard. Example scenario: Today is Election Day. If I go into my Parse Config Dashboard and add the following parameter - key: "Message", value: "Today is Election Day!", then open the client iOS app, I expect to see inside the UITableView feed a new cell at indexPath.row == 1 with the text, "Today is Election Day!" Tomorrow, when I open the app again, I should not see this cell anymore. Appreciate any help. Thank you!
