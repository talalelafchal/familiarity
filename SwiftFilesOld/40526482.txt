Cannot create NSManagedObject subclass
I am trying to learn CoreData. I created a single entity with only one attribute and created it's NSManagedObject using the Editor menu. But as soon as I try to build the app I am shown a Swift Compiler Error File Structure: Data.xcdatamodeld: Error:
You are manually generating a NSManagedObject subclass, which has already been generated by Xcode. Find detailed solutions here.
Select your entity(Item) -> Goto Data Model Inspector -> Under Class -> Select Codegen -> choose Manual/None. Now Restart your XCode. FYI check below image. I have created simple core data app which helps you to understand basics of how to insert data, delete and update. take a look here.
