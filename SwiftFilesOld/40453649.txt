How to set a PFQuery.wherekey to allow for multiple equalTo values?
I want to set a PFQuery's .whereKey equal to to an array's values (DB is a parse-server hosted by heroku). Is there anyway to set the .whereKey to allow for the value to be equal to any and all of the values within a particular array? For example: let valuesArray = ["Hello", "Hi", "Hey"] let query = PFQuery(className: "Example") query.whereKey("values", equalTo: valuesArray) query.findObjectsinBackground{ (objects, error) in //append an array } I want the query to return all values in the parse-server DB that has "values" equal to any and all of the values in the valuesArray. This current set up does not work, so is there anyway to achieve this desired result?
I believe you can use containedIn instead of equalTo: query.whereKey("value of the object", containedIn: valuesArray)
