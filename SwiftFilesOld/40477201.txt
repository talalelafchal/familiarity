Counting Up and Down using Volume buttons on iOS (Swift)
Hi I creating an app for myself, where I want to count and display the # on the screen. I want to use the volume buttons to count up and down. I was able create a button on screen to count up and down but I want to use the physical buttons. I have listed what I have so far, but the volume buttons doesn't seem to work. I've replaced AVAudioSession with AVAudioPlayer hoping to control the volume with the slider. I get a error EXC_BAD_ACCESS (Code=1, Adress=0x48)  import UIKit import AVFoundation class ViewController: UIViewController { var audioPlayer = AVAudioPlayer() @IBOutlet weak var counter: UILabel! @IBOutlet weak var tapCounterUp: UIButton! @IBOutlet weak var tapCounterDown: UIButton! @IBOutlet weak var tapReset: UIButton! @IBOutlet weak var volumeController: UISlider! override func viewDidLoad() { super.viewDidLoad() // Do any additional setup after loading the view, typically from a nib. } //Starts the count at 0 var count : Int = 0 //Adds +1 to Count @IBAction func buttonUp(_ sender: Any) { count += 1 counter.text = String(count) } //Subtracts -1 to Count @IBAction func buttonDown(_ sender: Any) { count -= 1 counter.text = String(count) } //Resets the Count to "0" @IBAction func buttonReset(_ sender: Any) { count = 0 counter.text = String(count) } //Volume Controller @IBAction func volumeControl(_ sender: UISlider) { let sliderValue = lroundf(sender.value) counter.text = "\(sliderValue)" **// This is were the Error occurs.** audioPlayer.volume = volumeController.value } // End of funtion, don't delete }
