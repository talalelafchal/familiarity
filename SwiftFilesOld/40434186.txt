Handwriting Recognition (OCR) to Image
I'm building an iOS app that allows users to take picture of something they wrote on a piece of paper. I need to be able to extract the handwriting only from the image and ignore everything else. (I don't need to convert it to text so it's not OCR; I just need the handwriting stored as an image.) I'm struggling to find the best solution to do this; however, some ideas we have are to: 1) Tear up an existing OCR library and see if we can just use the parts that recognise the handwriting and return a UIImage from that. We would stop the library from converting it to text. 2) Grab the pixel information for each of the corners of the image, analyse the colour until there is noticeable difference, creating a region of which we know the text is stored in. Once we have that region, crop to that region and apply transparency to the image (so we have just the text, no background). Once we have that, we can crop it again to get just the text and no transparent borders. 3) If you have any other ideas! Thanks.
