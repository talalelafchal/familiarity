converting ruby regex to swift regex
I've been using swift for 3 months now and am trying to convert a web app into iOS for practice and to progress my knowledge etc. After a bit of googling though, I am struggling to find an elegant way to perform the following functions in swift:  def search_for_float(line) line.gsub!(',','.') line.scan(/(\d+[,.]\d+)/).flatten[0].to_f end def search_for_integer(line) line.gsub!(',','.') line.scan(/(\d+)/).flatten[0].to_i end def search_for_words(line) line.split(" ").select{|word|word.match(/([a-zA-Z])/)}.join(" ").capitalize end Any help would be great as i'm struggling to find a basic tutorial that i can use to transfer my limited ruby knowledge across too.
