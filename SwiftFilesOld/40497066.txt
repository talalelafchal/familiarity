How to show type hierarcy in Xcode 8?
I am trying to draw things on a map (which is a MKMapView). MKMapView has an add(overlay : MKOverlay) method which allows you to add an overlay. The tutorial I am following uses a MKGeodesicPolyline as the argument to the add(overlay : MKOverlay) method. MKGeodesicPolyline is a subclass of MKPolyline, where MKPolyline conforms to MKOverlay. However, I would like to know what else (apart from MKGeodesicPolyline) I can pass to add(overlay : MKOverlay) method of a MKMapView. To know this, I need to learn everything that conforms to MKOverlay, either directly, or as being a descendant of a class which conforms to MKOverlay directly. How can I do this? I have used the symbol navigator but couldn't do what I wanted to achieve. How can I get a list of classes which I can pass to add(overlay : MKOverlay) method?
I'd just search for it. According to Xcode's built-in documentation for MKOverlay, the following classes adopt the protocol: • MKCircle • MKPolygon • MKPolyline • MKTileOverlay
