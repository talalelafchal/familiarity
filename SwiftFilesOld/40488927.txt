Error &quot;int1&quot; is not convertible to 'Bool' swift3
Im' quite new at swift and for my project I need to use swift3 and xcode8.1 I tried differents solutions, but noting works. I think it's because of the swift3 from swift2 conversion as I can see on differents topics. Nevertheless that didn't help me a lot. Here is my function: func startHeartRateUpdates() { output("Starting Heart Rate updates...") if let client = self.client { do { try client.sensorManager.startHeartRateUpdates(to: nil, withHandler: { (heartRateData: MSBSensorHeartRateData!, error: NSError!) in self.hrLabel.text = NSString(format: "Heart Rate: %3u %@", heartRateData.heartRate, heartRateData.quality == MSBSensorHeartRateQuality.acquiring ? "Acquiring" : "Locked") as String }) self.perform(#selector(ViewController.stopHeartRateUpdates), with: nil, afterDelay: 60) } catch let error as NSError { output("startHeartRateUpdatesToQueue failed: \(error.description)") } } else { output("Client not connected, can not start heart rate updates") } } And the only error I had is this 2 lines undernlined in red: heartRateData.quality == MSBSensorHeartRateQuality.acquiring ? "Acquiring" : "Locked") as String With the message: 'Int1' is not convertible to 'Bool' Thanks for your help.
I think the field acquiring is an int type. If you use int type in condional statement as a condion you should use ==. Example: heartRateData.quality = MSBSensorHeartRateQuality.acquiring == 1 ? "Acquiring" : "Locked") as String
