iOS to Node.js Backend SSL handshake failing
I have created a REST API with node.js and express. I am now trying to connect to the backend with a secure connection using Alamofire 3/https/SSL/TLS. I have a CA signed certificate, with a 2048 bit key installed on the server with the 'https' npm module. The error the server returns in xcode is below: 1 When I evaluate my SSLLabs it says certificate signed and TLS 1.2 / 1.1 all available etc as seen below. However interestingly under where it simulates requests the request record for iOS 9 (ATS) - Fails with 'Sever closed connection' as seen in the image below. TLS connection completed successfully2 iOS 9 simulated request fails [3] When I use the command: nscurl --ats-diagnostics --verbose Everything passes except the Default ATS Secure Connection and all three TLS exceptions as seen below: ATS Default Secure Connection Failing[4] 3 TLS exceptions failing[5] I am not sure what else to try as far as I understand I meet the requirements for ATS : TLS v1.2 Forward Secrey (I am not sure how to test this) At least a 2048 bit key - When I turn on CFNetworking logging in the logfile it points to Error code -1200 in CFNetwork/CFNetworkErrors.h which has the error reason 'The secure connection failed for an unknown reason.' I am at a lost as to what to try next, thanks. Sorry it will only let me post 2 links so I had to remove some images.
