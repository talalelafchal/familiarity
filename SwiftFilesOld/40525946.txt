UISearchController. search controller doesn't resize after device rotated
I'm using UISearchController on my view to find items. Search bar resizes properly in inactive move.However, if you enable searching and rotate device from landscape to portrait and to landscape mode again it won't fit to view.On my view I use navigation item which can be toggled in portrait mode. I tried to resize search bar view dynamically, it resized but position of search bar left the same. Initialization of search controller:  let searchController = UISearchController(searchResultsController: nil) searchController.searchResultsUpdater = self searchController.dimsBackgroundDuringPresentation = false definesPresentationContext = false tableView.tableHeaderView = searchController.searchBar tableView.register(UINib(nibName: tableCellName, bundle: nil), forCellReuseIdentifier: tableCellName) 1. 2.Let's enable searching and rotate device to portrait and landscape again. It seems that search bar width includes width of navigation view. However,when it's inactive it fits to entire view.
