Firebase ecommerce_purchase issue
I'm using Firebase Analitycs to log e-commerce events. Code: var parameters = [String: NSObject]() parameters[kFIRParameterCurrency] = template.currency as NSString parameters[kFIRParameterValue] = album.price! as NSNumber parameters[kFIRParameterTransactionID] = transaction.id as NSString parameters[kFIRParameterShipping] = template.shippingPrice as NSNumber FIRAnalytics.logEvent(withName: kFIREventEcommercePurchase, parameters: parameters) On Firebase console I can see that event is logged as expected But for some reason purchase data is not displayed on Firebase dashboard Thanks.
