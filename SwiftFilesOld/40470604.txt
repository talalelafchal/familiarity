LineChartData without x values on constructor Charts Swift 3
Iâ€™m using iOS Charts.framework (https://github.com/danielgindi/Charts) in my swift 3.0 xcodeproject. I know that "All dataset constructors have changed - they do not take an array of x-indices anymore" but how do I put strings on my x axis now if LineChartData doesn't have a "xVals" parameters anymore??? Before was so easy to do that... let weights: [Double] = self.getWeigths() let weightDates: [String] = self.getWeightDates() var yValues : [ChartDataEntry] = [ChartDataEntry]() for i in 0 ..< dateLastWeights.count { let entry = ChartDataEntry(x: Double(i), y: weights[i]) yValues.append(entry) } let set: LineChartDataSet = LineChartDataSet(values: yValues, label: "First Set") var dataSets : [LineChartDataSet] = [LineChartDataSet]() dataSets.append(set) let data: LineChartData = LineChartData(xVals: weightDates, dataSets: dataSets)
After trying lots of things and discussing with others developers we made it! self.lineChart.xAxis.granularity = 1 self.lineChart.xAxis.valueFormatter = DefaultAxisValueFormatter(block: { (index, _) -> String in return self.dateLastWeights[Int(index)] })
