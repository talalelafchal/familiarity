presentViewControler pushes all Controllers to stack
i have a tableView as my first view. every cell is clickable and on click, i used presentViewController to show current view with new data. i don't have navigation bar, so i cant use navigation controller and push. the problem is every time i click on a cell, it shows a new view (which is fine) but on pressing back button, it only moves back one step, but i want to make it go to first view. how can i do it? print("clicked " + String(indexPath.row) ) let storyboard = UIStoryboard(name: "Main", bundle: nil) let vc = storyboard.instantiateViewControllerWithIdentifier("playVideo") as! PlayVideoViewController preferences.setValue( self.video[indexPath.row].id , forKey: "id" ) //self.dismissViewControllerAnimated(false, completion: nil) self.presentViewController(vc, animated: true, completion: nil) back: self.dismissViewControllerAnimated(true, completion: nil)
If you want to go back to the first VC use that code: self.view.window!.rootViewController?.dismissViewControllerAnimated(true, completion: nil)
