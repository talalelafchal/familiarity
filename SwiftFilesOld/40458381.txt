How to add a ViewController in containerView programatically?
I know how to add a ViewController to a container if using an outlet through interface builder. You just drag an outlet from container to ViewController and boom, everythings all set and done. But when it comes to doing it programatically, I can't find any answer on the net? Can anyone give me a sample code? Thanks in advance. Let's say I have 2 View Controllers and 1 containerView. First Controller is the parent and inside is the container view and inside the containerView is the secondView Controller.
You need to first add constraints with parent view and container view, then you also need to add constraints to your container controller. Finally you should add the didMoveToParent in the end of setting all the constraints. The example is as follows, you can do a similar thing in your case.  NSLayoutConstraint.activateConstraints([ containerView.leadingAnchor.constraintEqualToAnchor(view.leadingAnchor, constant: 10), containerView.trailingAnchor.constraintEqualToAnchor(view.trailingAnchor, constant: -10), containerView.topAnchor.constraintEqualToAnchor(view.topAnchor, constant: 10), containerView.bottomAnchor.constraintEqualToAnchor(view.bottomAnchor, constant: -10), ]) NSLayoutConstraint.activateConstraints([ controller.view.leadingAnchor.constraintEqualToAnchor(containerView.leadingAnchor), controller.view.trailingAnchor.constraintEqualToAnchor(containerView.trailingAnchor), controller.view.topAnchor.constraintEqualToAnchor(containerView.topAnchor), controller.view.bottomAnchor.constraintEqualToAnchor(containerView.bottomAnchor) ]) controller.didMoveToParentViewController(self) or you can also refer this: https://codedump.io/share/jVuaGlB85VtK/1/how-to-add-a-container-view-programmatically
