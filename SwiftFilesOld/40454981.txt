Is a semaphore causing my crash?
This is a follow on from: Analysing App IPS file in XCode I was able to re-symbolicates the file, which resulted in: http://pastebin.com/y2NXGLtt I can see my app crashed here: 0 libsystem_kernel.dylib 0x0000000188ba01a8 semaphore_wait_trap + 8 1 libdispatch.dylib 0x0000000188a8b7ec _dispatch_semaphore_wait_slow + 216 2 libswiftDispatch.dylib 0x00000001006e5dc4 DispatchSemaphore.wait(wallTimeout : DispatchWallTime) -> DispatchTimeoutResult (__hidden#1676_:177) 3 FlightMachine 0x000000010010b970 DebugLog.sendLogSynchronously() -> () (DebugLog.swift:0) 4 FlightMachine 0x000000010015b79c @objc AppDelegate.applicationWillResignActive(UIApplication) -> () (AppDelegate.swift:0) This is the source code of sendLogSynchronusly(): http://pastebin.com/FrbFRiYD My question is, how do I know what went wrong in sendLogSynchronusly() as I can't seem to replicate it myself. I see references to "semaphore", so I'm guessing something is wrong with my semaphore usage. Does anything look like it might cause a crash to you? EDIT: Could it be that an error condition is being met, then because I return immediately it stays locked? However would this cause a crash? It doesn't seem to if i immediately return before calling signal. Thanks.
