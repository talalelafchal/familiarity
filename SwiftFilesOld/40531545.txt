Running 1 of 2 custom shell script stuck for 2 minutes in Xcode
Running 1 of 2 custom shell scripts it stuck for 2 minutes while trying to build the app. I tried to fix with the solution :Xcode custom shell scripts are slowing down the compiling time , but still it slows the build process :(. Build Stuck for 2m here Build Phases Further informations: Xcode 8.1 Swift 3.0 Podfile: # Uncomment this line to define a global platform for your project platform :ios, '9.0' # Uncomment this line if you're using Swift use_frameworks! target 'MyProject' do # Network pod 'Alamofire' pod 'SwiftyJSON' # UI side pod 'Material', git: 'https://github.com/CosmicMind/Material.git', branch: 'development' pod 'SDWebImage' pod 'UIScrollView-InfiniteScroll' pod 'TPKeyboardAvoiding' pod 'SwiftKeychainWrapper', git: 'https://github.com/jrendel/SwiftKeychainWrapper.git', branch: 'develop' pod 'DropDown' # Facebook pod 'FacebookCore' pod 'FacebookLogin' pod 'FacebookShare' # Autolayout pod 'SnapKit' pod 'KeepLayout' # Metrics pod 'Google/Analytics' # Fabric.io pod 'Fabric' pod 'Crashlytics' end target 'MyProjectTests' do end target 'MyProjectUITests' do end
Finally, I found a solution for this. At least the total build time now is 57sec. I found that 'Embed Pods Framework' (Once 'Embed Pods Framework' and 'CP Embed Pods Framework') builds twice. Anyway, I don't have an idea why I have both of them on build phases. I found for this on Report Navigator. Solution: 1) I let only active âœ“ Run script only when installing only for'[CP]Embed Pods Framework' 2) Optimization Level on Build Settings for debug was -None. I set to Fast... 3) Tip: use Simulator instead of Device for minimal build time.
