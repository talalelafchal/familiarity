Swift - webview wont load
I am using swift 3 and I am trying to load a webview programmatically like so: let webview = UIWebView() webview.scalesPageToFit = true webview.autoresizesSubviews = true webview.autoresizingMask = [.flexibleWidth, .flexibleHeight] webview.frame = CGRect(x: 0, y: 0, width: 800, height: 800) webview.delegate = self let localUrl = String(format:"http://www.google.com") let url = NSURL.fileURL(withPath: localUrl) webview.loadRequest(URLRequest(url: url)) self.view.addSubview(webview) but all I get is a blank white screen. I get no errors at all, please help!
One problem is that http://www.google.com is not a file URL. So you cannot make a fileURL out of it. Just make a plain URL. Another problem, on iOS 9 and 10, is that you cannot, by default, load an http URL. You have to use https.
et webview = UIWebView() webview.scalesPageToFit = true webview.autoresizesSubviews = true webview.autoresizingMask = [.flexibleWidth, .flexibleHeight] webview.frame = CGRect(x: 0, y: 0, width: 800, height: 800) webview.delegate = self webview.loadRequest(URLRequest(url: URL(string: "https://www.google.com")!)) self.view.addSubview(webview) That works for me, although it doesn't fit properly, on the iPhone 7 simulator unless you change the web view frame to webview.frame = self.view.frame You were trying to turn a string into a file url and then load the file url instead of a normal url. Also, recently, Apple made it so http://whatever.com doesn't work, you need to use https://whatever.com.
