admob interstitial alway returns false
I am fairly new to AdMob. I tried looking up problem online and here but I can't find a solution that works for me. So basically I am trying to create this game using Swift and in the gameviewcontroller I create 3 functions that create the ad and then I want to call them in my StartMenu scene. Here is my functions for ad interstitial in gameviewcontroller: func getInterstitialAd(){ interstitial = GADInterstitial(adUnitID: "AdMob Unit ID") let interstitialRequest = GADRequest() interstitial.load(interstitialRequest) } func showAd() { print(interstitial.isReady) if interstitial.isReady { interstitial.present(fromRootViewController: self) } else { interstitial = createAd() print("Ad wasn't ready") } } func createAd() -> GADInterstitial{ let interstital = GADInterstitial(adUnitID: "AdMob Unit ID") interstitial.load(GADRequest()) return interstital } and in my StartMenu Scene:  var viewController = GameViewController() I have this in my game over function and it basically gets called when the player dies: viewController.getInterstitialAd() viewController.showAd() And every time the player dies it prints false and ad wasn't ready.
