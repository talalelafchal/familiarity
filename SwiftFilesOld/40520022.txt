indexPathsForSelectedItems not return IndexPath on Swift 3
I am using Swift 3 to get indexPath for selected items. The code looks like this. override func prepare(for segue: UIStoryboardSegue, sender: Any?) { let indexPaths = collectionView.indexPathsForSelectedItems! print(indexPaths) } But this one print out empty array such as [] rather than an array of selected items of collection view cell. How can I get the indexPath row of selected cell?
I know what is wrong with my code. I have used didDeselectItemAt rather than didSelectItemAt. Case closed. Thanks all.
