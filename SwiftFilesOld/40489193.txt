How to remove alpha of iconView in GoogleMaps?
I know it sounds easy but by default GoogleMaps default function iconView has a default alpha of 0.9. I tried changing it to 1 but it's still the same. Any suggestion? Thanks in advance. [EDIT] This is my code  let cView = UIView(frame: CGRectMake(0,0,400*PT,300*PT)) let innerView = UIView(frame: CGRectMake(0,0,400*PT,190*PT)) innerView.backgroundColor = UIColor.whiteColor() innerView.layer.cornerRadius = 3 innerView.layer.masksToBounds = true innerView.alpha = 1 cView.addSubview(innerView) let cIcon = UIImageView(frame: CGRectMake(0*PT, 200*PT, 90*PT, 100*PT)) cIcon.image = UIImage(named: "1.png") cView.addSubview(cIcon) cView.backgroundColor = UIColor.clearColor() item.iconView = cView [EDIT] Added screenshot of the output [EDIT] Final output after the answer below
Might be a bit obvious, but can you try adding this? item.opacity = 1
