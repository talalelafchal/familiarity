how to call all methods and functions from view controller to app delegate?
Hi am developing a app using swift2 in my app i want to track location for every 5 minutes when user successfully logged in now i can successfully track location of the user now i want to track when the app is in backgrounded for that i have to use app delegate but all functions and methods are i wrote in view controllers only so how can i call view controllers method and function to app delegate. code in viewController: class ThirdViewController: UIViewController{ In view did load: { ////// i created timer scheduled with time internal ///// } ////// Here am fetched current locations and performed some function for timer to execute ////// } In my appDelegate: func applicationDidEnterBackground(application: UIApplication) { if UIApplication.sharedApplication().applicationState != .Active{ //here i have to call that timer function execute how to do that???? }
You can fire notification when app goes to background func applicationDidEnterBackground(application: UIApplication) { if UIApplication.sharedApplication().applicationState != .Active{ NSNotificationCenter.defaultCenter().postNotificationName("Notificationname", object: nil) } } in your controller view did load dd observer for notification // add observer for notification. NSNotificationCenter.defaultCenter().addObserver(self, selector: #selector(self.notificationReceived), name: "Notificationname", object: nil) Method handler for received Notification func notificationReceived() { // do what you want to do here. }
You would want to create a class with your function inside it and then call it from your app delegate, you can do this like this: Create a swift file with the name of your class e.g. MyClass.swift Then you create the class in your file and add the function in it: class MyClassName { Add your function in here } Then you call it from appDelegate.swift like this: let myClassVar: MyClassName? Then call the function like this -> myClassVar.functionName
Like this, func applicationDidEnterBackground(application: UIApplication) { if UIApplication.sharedApplication().applicationState != .Active{ let thirdViewController = ThirdViewController() thirdViewController.functionYouWantToCall() } Thanks :)
