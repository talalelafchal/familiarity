How to check the NSNumber is boolean or int32?
I have declared one variable as NSNumber and assigned bool true. Then I have declared another NSNumber and assigned int 1. When I try to retrieve the datatype of both variables, both returns as Int. This issue happened only in iPhone 5 and lower which is 32bit architecture. How to resolve this issue? var number: NSNumber = 1 var boolienValue: NSNumber = true func getType(value: AnyObject) -> String? { if value is Int { return "Int" } else if value is Bool { return = "Bool" } else if value is Double { return = "Double" } return nil }
