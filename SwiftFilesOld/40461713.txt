iOS Swift: is there a hack to get text input from SLComposeViewController when using SLServiceTypeTwitter?
I wonder if there is a way to get the text input from SLComposeViewController to check if the text typed by the user contains a specific word before being sent. I know that SLComposeViewController does not have a text property but I would like to check it without having to implement a UITextView to be check before assigning its text to SLComposeViewController. Do you have any suggestion on how this can be implemented? Some posts suggests to loop through the subviews but I can't get UITextView by doing that.
