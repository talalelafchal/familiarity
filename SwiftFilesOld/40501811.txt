Sign and Package Application for Development Distribution in XCode 6.4
I've an application written in Swift that only run on XCode 6.4. Right now, I want to create .ipa for testing in Appium. I can create .ipa but with signed with ad hoc distribution. Then I run auto-testing on appium, and it gives me an error: Target failed to run: Permission ti debug com.*****.****** was denied. The app must be signed with development identity (e.g. iOS Developer). In xcode 7, we could archive > export > Save for Development Deployment if we want to signing our app with development that Appium needed. But I can't find "Save for Development Deployment" in Xcode 6.4. Any idea to solve this problem? Thank you so much.
