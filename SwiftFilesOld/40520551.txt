Is there any way to get event or notification when i tap on control centre(playing song in music player) in IOS
Steps in detail 1) Open app(custom music player app like “apple music app”) and play songs in app 2) Navigate to preference(any other) screen in app 3) Press home button (Now app in background and playing music like “apple music app”, i also can do next, previous tracks) 4) Now, Question when I tap on album image, track title or album name, app gets active and comes in foreground any way to get this event in application so i can open music player and restore UI for that state?
