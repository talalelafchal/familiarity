how to upgrade existing framework which installed using carthage
I have installed charts framework using carthage. Now need to update framework for swift 3 version. Carthage/Build/iOS/Charts.framework/Charts compiled with older version of Swift language (2.0) than previous files (3.0) for architecture x86_64 clang: error: linker command failed with exit code 1 (use -v to see invocation) How to upgrade framework?
There is a new release for Swift 3. You need to update your Cartfile to point to this version: github "danielgindi/Charts" == 3.0.0 Then re-run carthage update.
