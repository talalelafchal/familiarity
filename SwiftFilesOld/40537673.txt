Issue: value of type string? has no member toInt
I had two issues when I tried to compile my Swift application, it consists on the factorization of a number to prime numbers. I attached an image to show de issues. What can I do? Thanks @IBOutlet weak var textField: UITextField! @IBOutlet weak var outputMessage: UILabel! @IBAction func checkButton(sender: UIButton) { var isPrime = true var inputNumber = textField.text.toInt var multiples:Int = 0 if (inputNumber != nil) { if (inputNumber <= 0) { outputMessage.text = "Neither 0 nor negative numbers are considered prime numbers!" textField.resignFirstResponder() } else { if (inputNumber == 1) { outputMessage.text = "1 isn't a prime number!" textField.resignFirstResponder() } else { for var i = 2; i < inputNumber; i += 1 { if (inputNumber! % i == 0) { // Number is not prime isPrime = false multiples = i I attach an image to show the two issues I have
