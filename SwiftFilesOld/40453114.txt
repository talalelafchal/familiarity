Swift unwrapping optional in conditional
var optionalname: String? = "QUAN" let name1 = optionalname var greeting1 = "Hello, \(name1)" print(greeting1) if let name2 = optionalname { var greeting2 = "Hello, \(name2)" print(greeting2) } print(greeting1) gives: "Hello, Optional("QUAN")\n" print(greeting2) gives: "Hello, QUAN\n" Can someone helps me explain the reasons behind the difference ? Thanks!
If your value is an optional(?) it means that there does not have to be a value (It can be empty and there is no error). If you have empty non-optional value your code will fail. There is an article from apple about this: https://developer.apple.com/library/content/documentation/Swift/Conceptual/Swift_Programming_Language/OptionalChaining.html This is what apple says about optionals: Optional chaining is a process for querying and calling properties, methods, and subscripts on an optional that might currently be nil.
