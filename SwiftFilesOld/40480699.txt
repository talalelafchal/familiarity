Push to Second View Controller with mapkit info button
Once a Pin is selected is selected in my app, I want the info button to link to the below view controller. I would know how to do this if the button was on the screen from the start, but it is not present until a pin is selected. How Can I implement this? my button is currently simply coded as the following:  func mapView(_ mapView: MKMapView, annotationView view: MKAnnotationView, calloutAccessoryControlTapped control: UIControl) { if control == view.rightCalloutAccessoryView { print("Button tapped ") } } Also, If this is Segue would I be able to have this one view controller and have the text and photos change depending on which info pin button is clicked on? Thanks for your help
If your annotation has a title your map view will respond to selecting the annotation through the delegate method optional func mapView(_ mapView: MKMapView, didSelect view: MKAnnotationView) This method will be called by the map view when you select your annotation. You can implement this method in the view controller that you have designated as the delegate of the map view and tell your map view delegate what to do, including perform segue. This means that you have your viewcontroller initiated, like: class myMapViewController: UIViewController, MKMapViewDelegate { // Your class code starts here } Then somewhere in your viewDidLoad() you declare that the delegate of your map view is this view controller by: self.myMapView.delegate = self So, in the delegate you can program your preparations before calling perform segue and then in prepare for segue you prepare the destination view controller for its actions on the annotation being selected. Just note, the delegate method gives you the annotation view you selected. The annotation that goes with this annotation view is obtained with: let theAnnotation = view.annotation in this delegate method. Hope this helps.
