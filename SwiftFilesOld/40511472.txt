Access custom cell from XIB in UICollectionViewController for sizeForItemAtIndexPath
I have spent 3 days of searching and reading. In my IOS app I have a custom Cell for UICollectionView with xib File. In this custom cell I have 3 labels, images and buttons. 1 label from it is in the middle and always gets different sizes because it's multiline. So I must calculate all items height. It's not the problem but the problem is only with this one multiline label. So I want calculate the size for each cell and get the size for sizeForItemAtIndexPath in UICollectionViewController. After 3 days I think I cannot access this. Can I do this from the custom cell class? If yes, how? If I can access it in UICollectionViewController, how? //MARK: - CollectionView Flow Layout extension PhotosCollectionViewController: UICollectionViewDelegateFlowLayout { func collectionView(_ collectionView: UICollectionView, layout collectionViewLayout: UICollectionViewLayout, sizeForItemAt indexPath: IndexPath) -> CGSize { let viewSize = super.view.bounds.size let spacing: CGFloat = 0.5 let width = (viewSize.width) - spacing - 10 /* Here I need my cell with label name "Beschreibungstext" to calculate the hight from the label with help from rectangle. return CGSize(width: width, height: customhight) */ return CGSize(width: width, height: CGFloat(400)) } }
