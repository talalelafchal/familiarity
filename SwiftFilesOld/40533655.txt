How to print the result of an if else statement into a specific text box
I'm a relatively new coder who wants to try out the iOS development language "Swift". The app I am creating is a weather app that will show the degrees in celsius and possibly some advice which is where the if statement comes in. However, I am encountering an issue with my code which I do not know how to solve. import UIKit class ViewController: UIViewController { @IBOutlet weak var weatherLabel: UILabel! @IBOutlet weak var quote: UILabel! override func viewDidLoad() { super.viewDidLoad() let apiKey = "60e0655f404d7bf1" let url = NSURL(string: "https://api.wunderground.com/api/eb56be2ac82d34b5/geolookup/conditions/forecast/q/Canada/Toronto.json") let data = NSData(contentsOfURL: url!) do { let json = try NSJSONSerialization.JSONObjectWithData(data!, options: .AllowFragments) let weather = json["current_observation"]!!["temp_c"] weatherLabel.text = "\(weather!!)" var quote = weather var celsius = 20 if celsius >= quote { print("Its cold outside, bring a jacket!") }else{ print("Its hot outside, remember to drink water!") //if the weather in celsius is over 20 degrees, say ("Its hot outside, remember to drink water!") } } catch { print("error serializing JSON: \(error)") } // Do any additional setup after loading the view, typically from a nib. } } Does anyone know how I can set the quote in one specific text label and the degrees in the weatherLabel? I also have an error saying that I can't convert AnyObject to an int.
Var quote = Int(weather) use this.
