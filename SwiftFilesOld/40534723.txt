Autosizing UITableViewCell without using estimatedRowHeight and avoiding &quot;UIView-Encapsulated-Layout-Height&quot; errors
I have a problem where I need to use autosizing cells but I can't use UITableView's estimatedRowHeight property because using it kind of "disables" cell's layout until cell is reused. More information about this problem here: UITableViewCell layout not updating until cell is reused Trying to use autosizing cells without estimatedRowHeight leads to table view putting height constraint on cell's content view (height equals to 43.5 point). In error logs this constraint is the famous 'UIView-Encapsulated-Layout-Height' UITableViewCellContentView:0x7fd63d508490.height == 43.5 (active) And because my cell's height is not equal to 43.5 points, auto layout decides that this height constraint is more important than my cell's layout and fits my cell content in 43.5 points. So I can't use estimatedRowHeight because it breaks auto layout, but without it my layout also gets broken. My question is: how can I safely deprioritize this UIView-Encapsulated-Layout-Height constraint? Is there any way I can get autosizing cells without using estimatedRowHeight?
