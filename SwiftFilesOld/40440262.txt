iOS function similar ti viewDidLoad()
I search a function (included in iOS or with external library) that is very similar to viewDidLoad(). The difference should be that the searched function will be used only when the App starts for the first time, that means when the user opened the App. ViewDidLoad() is used every time when the view was loaded. But the searched function xy() will only used when a view is loaded for the first time in the runtime. This is the normal version User opened App, View 1 opens -> ViewDidLoad() of view 1 -> User opens view 2 .... -> User goes back to View 1 -> ViewDidLoad() of View 1 I search this User opened App, View 1 opens -> ViewDidLoad() of view 1 and function xy() -> User opens view 2 .... -> User goes back to View 1 -> ViewDidLoad() of View 1 (this time not function xy() because the view was already loaded in this runtime) Thanks for your help!
You can place code you need to run once in the dispatch_once block for obj-c and use static var for swift Obj-c: - (void)viewDidLoad { [super viewDidLoad]; static dispatch_once_t onceToken; dispatch_once(&onceToken, ^{ // code you place here will run once }); } Swift 3 static var didInit = false override func viewDidLoad() { super.viewDidLoad() if MyClass.didInit == false { MyClass.didInit = true // code you place here will run once } }
Did you try func application(_ application: UIApplication, didFinishLaunchingWithOptions launchOptions: [UIApplicationLaunchOptionsKey: Any]?) -> Bool
