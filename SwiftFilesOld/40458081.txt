Swift firebase search query returning null
I am trying to query handle names in my Firebase database My structure is as follows: handles "handleString": "userId" "jsmith": "adsalsdjldakldsk" "johndoe": "dslfsdjlkfsdljkfslkd" Currently I have a function setup so everytime the value of the text field is changed it runs a query to search inside the handles node. @IBAction func searching(_ sender: Any) { print("Searching...") let searchTerm = handleSearchField.text DataService.instance.handleRef.queryEqual(toValue: searchTerm).observe(.value, with: { (snapshot) in print(snapshot) print(snapshot.key) print("Search term: \(searchTerm)") }, withCancel: nil) } If I observe the handles node I can see the contents inside however when I try and do a queryEqual to it always returns a null value. I am trying to query the "handleStrings" or the keys of all the children inside the handles node. Any help would be awesome I know I can just search .child(searchTerm) and get an exact result but if possible I would like to display terms similar
