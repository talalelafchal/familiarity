Unable to load TableView in Today Extension ios
I was unable to load a tableview inside today extension. I deleted the initial view controller and replaced it with a tableView controller. Did added the delegates in table view NCWidgetProviding and its function widgetPerformUpdate. It was just a sample app, to check the today extension. Can anybody respond with a solution !!! Thanks
Few things I noticed: try setting tableView's delegate and datasource in viewDidLoad(): self.tableView.delegate = self self.tableView.dataSource = self it's better to use tableView.dequeueReusableCellWithIdentifier with indexPath: let cell = tableView.dequeueReusableCellWithIdentifier("reuseIdentifier", forIndexPath: indexPath) More on this here If none of the above helps, maybe there's something wrong with autolayout? Table might be displayed, it's just not visible.
