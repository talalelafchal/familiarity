Google Maps SDK for iOS
I'm trying to implement google maps in one of my application. I had integrated the SDK and followed all the steps from below link https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/ios-sdk/start But I'm getting following error *** Terminating app due to uncaught exception 'GMSServicesException', reason: 'GoogleMaps.bundle requires Google Maps SDK for iOS to be part of your target under 'Copy Bundle Resources'' Also, I had try to solve it using below link Google Maps SDK for iOS requires GoogleMaps.bundle to be part of your target under 'Copy Bundle Resources But it didn't help. I'm still getting the same error. Also my current xCode Version is 8.0. Any help will be appreciated. Thanks in advance
