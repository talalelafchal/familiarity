Swift 2 to Swift 3
In Swift 2 I was able to write this statement: var reachability = SCNetworkReachabilityCreateWithName(kCFAllocatorDefault, "www.apple.com").takeRetainedValue() In Swift 3 now it says that SCNetworkReachability? has no member takeRetainedValue().
Just remove the takeRetainedValue() you don't need it anymore. var reachability = SCNetworkReachabilityCreateWithName(kCFAllocatorDefault, "www.apple.com")
