Swift: Find Realm Object in Array
How to find an object from realm array of object, for example i have object like this: var employee :Array<CWEmployee> = [] i need to find the employee where the name for example "Mike". I try like this but it gave me an error: var single = realm.objects(self.employee).filter("name = 'Mike'") Thanks
There's no Realm class named Array; the only classes Realm provides with that collection behavior are List, Results, and LinkingObjects. In this case, I'm assuming that's a standard Swift Array and CWEmployee is a Realm Object subclass that you've manually placed in there yourself. Either way, you're using realm.objects() incorrectly. objects() requires the class reference itself as the argument; not an object instance. If you wanted to find all employees named Mike in your Realm file: let allMikes = realm.objects(CWEmployee.self).filter("name = 'Mike'") If your employee property contains manually filtered CWEmployee objects, and you want to further filter that to find Mike, you should be able to use Swift's Array.filter method to do that. let allMikes = employee.filter { $0.name == "Mike" } Let me know if you need any further clarification.
