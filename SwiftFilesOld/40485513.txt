How to show activity indicator while passing between view controller
Lets say I have 2 ViewControllers, in my MainViewController I have a button which performs a segue to SecondViewController. When button tapped, I'm saving some initial data to coreData, so it takes some time. Here is the thing that I want to do; While passing between ViewControllers, I want to show ActivityIndicator, but its starts after SecondViewController is opened. Could you help me? I'm new to Swift. Here is the code I used in my MainVC: override func prepare(for segue: UIStoryboardSegue, sender: Any?) { if (segue.identifier == "SecondViewController") { SwiftSpinner.show("Loading") // Act. indicator found on github willRunOnce() // Here Im saving data to CoreData SwiftSpinner.hide() } }
Instead of adding code of ActivityIndicator in prepare(for:sender:) method you need to call it in the Button action and after that call performSegue(withIdentifier:sender:) method. @IBAction func onBtnSkip(_ sender: UIButton) { SwiftSpinner.show("Loading") // Act. indicator found on github willRunOnce() // Here Im saving data to CoreData SwiftSpinner.hide() //Now performSegue self.performSegue(withIdentifier: "identifier", sender: nil) }
