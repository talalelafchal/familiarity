Buttons in LinkedIn's authentication dialog box block
I have a webview that does Linkedin Authentication. When the user successfully logs in and is presented the dialog box, the buttons on the bottom get blocked. Now if the user scrolls up to try to tapping on one of the buttons, then the webview ignores the interaction. I tried setting the content offset of the scrollview contained the webview, but that didn't work either. Here is a screenshot: Example of buttons blocked in LinkedIn Dialog In the screenshot shown, if the user zooms in, then scrolls, then they can tap on either the cancel button or the allow button. But that isn't a pleasant user experience. Are there any work arounds for this?
