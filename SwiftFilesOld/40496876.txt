Swift SpriteKit turning sprite to certain angle
In Swift SpriteKit I have the "angle" of a sprite stored in an integer. It starts at zero and adds or subtracts 45 whenever the user rotates left or right (0-360), how would I create an SKAction to rotate the sprite to the stored angle? (in the case that the angle gets shifted unintentionally)
iOS generally uses radians to describe angles. You'll need to convert your angle in degrees to radians before you can create the action. let radAngle = CGFloat(angle) * .pi / 180 let rotationAction = SKAction.rotateToAngle(radAngle, duration: 0.5) node.runAction(rotationAction)
