Swift Compiler Error Group
Sorry to post this again. But I really got lost in solving this bug in my Xcode. I am using Xcode Version 8.0 swift 3 , I have got this error when building the project: Command failed due to signal: Segmentation fault: 11, and it shows me in the storyboards the code in black color for a while. Also, there is a notification says An internal error occurred, Source editor functionality is limited, attempting to restore, Report a Bug. I have searched a lot and most things I found about building, cleaning, reopening the project. Also, I tried to uncheck and recheck the Automatically managed signing for my project. I hope to hear from you the best solution for my problem waiting for your replay greatest coders
I had this same issue. I went to the 'Debug Session' window and saw I had type conversion issues. I was trying to determine is an object was a Set and needed to evaluate it as a Set<String>. Not sure if that'll help you, but check out the 'Debug Session' window to see which view controller class has the issue and what it is.
