Applying a texture material to custom objects in SceneKit
SceneKit beginner here, doing an iOS project. I have been wrapping textures around SCN geometry (spheres, so far) like this: let scene = SCNScene() var planet : SCNGeometry planet = SCNSphere(radius: 1.0) let material = SCNMaterial() material.diffuse.contents = UIImage(named: "texture.jpg") planet.materials = [material] let planetNode = SCNNode(geometry: planet) scene.rootNode.addChildNode(planetNode) And this seems to be working fine. I have textures that are meant to apply to spheres anyways. However, when I try to load a custom obj file, texture materials seem to refuse to map onto it when I load the geometry from the obj like so: let scene = SCNScene() var planet : SCNGeometry let tempScene = SCNScene(named: "model.obj") planet = tempScene!.rootNode.childNodes[0].geometry! let material = SCNMaterial() material.diffuse.contents = UIImage(named: "texture.jpg") planet.materials = [material] let planetNode = SCNNode(geometry: planet) scene.rootNode.addChildNode(planetNode) The model object, however, appears to show just fine, albeit, without the texture. Any pointers?
