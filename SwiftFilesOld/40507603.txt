UItext field value is not updating when i change the value
I have one uitext field, when my app load and user can edit my uitext field value and can send it to server. But when i did that, what the value i am entering in my text field is not updating to my server. For example, if i keep the default value as 0, and if i edit my uitext field value and if i send it to server. Still my default 0 value is showing in my server. Please help me out. ! Here my code that i am asigning the uitext field label value to string variable. And i am sending that value to server. var proqty : String? proqty = productQty.text I dont know whether my value is updating in my proqty or not. Thanks in advance !!
You can print the value before sent to server, and can you describe the answer clearly or give me more your code.I guess, maybe you just use productQty.text instead of proqty.
