Memory Leak when subclassing custom UIViewController
I've been recently suffering a memory leak when profiling with instruments. So the situation is I have a parent AVC which inherits from UIViewController and a subclass of AVC called BVC. this BVC has an instance of a helper class that gets initialized on viewDidLoad. Well, instruments claims there is a memory leak on viewDidLoad. Here's the sample code I used to reproduce the problem. Weird thing is if "a" is a member of AVC and initialized in BVC "A" it does not leak. import UIKit class A { } class AVC: UIViewController { override func viewDidLoad() { super.viewDidLoad() } } class BVC: AVC { var a: A! override func viewDidLoad() { super.viewDidLoad() a = A() } } So the question is, why is "a" leaking when it is an instance of BVC and not AVC? Also, here's a capture of the memory graph in both cases. Thanks
You should declare a as var a: A? never used forced unbinding of optionals.
