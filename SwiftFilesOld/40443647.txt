XCode 8, Swift 3 and iOS 9.3 Base SDK
I have looked around for all relevant XCode questions/answers but couldn't find a a solution. What I need to do is to have my project in XCode 8 & Swift 3 and build it with the base SDK of iOS 9.x. What I have done: Downloaded XCode 7 and copied over the relevant iOS 9.x SDKs to XCode 8. Created a new basic project in XCode 8 (Swift 3). Changed the base SDK to iOS 9.3. Hit the Run button. The error that I get is: <unknown>:0: error: Swift does not support the SDK 'iPhoneOS9.3.sdk' Command /Applications/Xcode.app/Contents/Developer/Toolchains/XcodeDefault.xctoolchain/usr/bin/swiftc failed with exit code 1 Can we conclude that you can't have base SDK as iOS 9.3 in XCode 8?
