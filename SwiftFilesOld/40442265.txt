AVPlayer takes long time to start playing
After the update to Swift 3 I´ve realised that my App takes long time to start playing an audio file from a remote server. In Swift 2.3 this didn't´t happen. I´ve been trying to debug it all day long but I couldn't´t find anything. I´ve been printing the states of the AVPlayer at each moment and I found that it changes from Loading to Playing within seconds but then it takes around 20 seconds to really start playing the song. I am using Jukebox by TeodorPatras
I finally fixed it myself with the next line of code: player?.playImmediately(atRate: 1.0) What that line does is, it starts playing immediately without ensuring that the buffer it´s enough to not suffer interruptions. But in my case I prefer that over having to wait for several seconds.
