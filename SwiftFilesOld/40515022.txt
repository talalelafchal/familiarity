subclassed SKLabelNode to present scene, how?
I have a subclass of SKLabelNode that's instanced three or four times, each with a name, and a destination: // import SpriteKit class MenuButton: SKLabelNode { var goesTo = SKScene() override init() { super.init() print("test... did this get called? WTF? HOW/WHY/WHERE?") } convenience init(text: String, color: SKColor, destination: SKScene){ self.init() self.text = text self.color = color goesTo = destination } override func touchesBegan(_ touches: Set<UITouch>, with event: UIEvent?) { let nextScene = goesTo // .....????????????????? // HOW DO I GET THIS TO FIND ITS SCENE... // THEN ITS VIEW, THEN PRESENT this nextScene???? } required init?(coder aDecoder: NSCoder) { fatalError("init(coder:) has not been implemented") } } I'm at a loss as to how to get at the view I need to call the scene change on.
Every SKNode has a scene property which returns the scene where the node lives. And every SKScene as a view property, so override func touchesBegan(_ touches: Set<UITouch>, with event: UIEvent?) { let nextScene = goesTo self.scene?.view?.presentScene(nextScene) }
