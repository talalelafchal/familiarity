Pass an image between two already loaded view controllers
This may be trivial, but I'm new to Swift and would appreciate any help. App is designed to modify images. I have 3 ViewControllers: Contains UIScrollView Action - All action is done to images (contained within UIScrollView) Preview - Image preview (contained within UIScrollView) I want to move a UIImage from Action to Preview. All of the view controllers are already open. Action and Preview are side by side children of the UIScrollView. I don't want to open them again or move to them automatically. I just want to update the image in Preview after modifications are completed within Action. I'm using Swift 3.0 and Xcode 8.
Normally there is only one viewController visible at a time, so assuming this is the case, the typical way to communicate between them is a property on the destination, and often this is done through a separate protocol. For example, protocol CanDisplayImage { var imageToDisplay: UIImage? { get; set; } } Then your destination viewController would implement this protocol: class MyPreviewController: UIViewController, CanDisplayImage { var imageToDisplay: UIImage? func viewDidLoad() { theImageView.image = imageToDisplay } } And then your source viewController causes a segue to the destination, and sets this property in its override func prepare(for segue: UIStoryboardSegue, sender: Any?) { if let dest = segue.destination as? CanDisplayImage { dest.imageToDisplay = theImageToPreview } } How you choose to cause the segue can be done in different ones. The most common is to ctrl-drag from a button or whatever within the source viewController to anywhere within the destination viewController. Note that I have not checked the above code actually compiles, so I might have some typos.
