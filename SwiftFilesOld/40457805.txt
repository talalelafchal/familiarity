what is different between init() and init(_:bool)
var LocalFile = "xxx.json" var Delta = false var priority = DISPATCH_QUEUE_PRIORITY_DEFAULT init(){ priority = DISPATCH_QUEUE_PRIORITY_HIGH } init(_:Bool){ Delta = true priority = DISPATCH_QUEUE_PRIORITY_LOW } func getList(postData: Dictionary<String, String>){ let localdata = readfile(LocalFile) if (localdata != "" && Delta == false){} else{ } } I am just a beginner for learning Swift. When I look through this class, I wonder why this class contains 2 init()? How does it work with "priority"?
init(){ priority = DISPATCH_QUEUE_PRIORITY_HIGH } It is a default constructor. It means your instance variable will be initialized by default with their respective values. Here the priority is HIGH (DISPATCH_QUEUE_PRIORITY_HIGH) init(_:Bool){ Delta = true priority = DISPATCH_QUEUE_PRIORITY_LOW } 1 . It is parameterised, constructor. It means you are initializing Delta while you are creating object of this class. 2 . Here the priority is LOW (DISPATCH_QUEUE_PRIORITY_LOW)
First, it should be localFile and delta. (notice case). Second, this is a terribly written API. I'm guessing the creator was wanting two different initializers, one with a high priority and one with a low priority that initializes delta.
