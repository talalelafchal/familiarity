How to use UITabBarController with NavigationBar and ScrollView?
I am using SLPagingView to have a moving NavigationBar in my Swift 3 project. The controller is a SubClass of UIViewController with a ScrollView. I want to use a UITabBarController as one of the embeddeded UIViewControllers. The problem is, that my TabBar is missing: The white bar within the green controller shows the problem: Current outcome on the Simulator (iPhone 7 Plus): I guess the TabBar is missing in size of the NavigationBar + the StatusBar. In other controllers I'm using UITableViews with inset. How do I display the UITabBar in the current situation? Help is very appreciated. Edit: As a current work around, I have the "solution" to move the TabBar to a desired position. class TabC: UITabBarController { override func viewDidLoad() { super.viewDidLoad() let statusBarHeight = UIApplication.shared.statusBarFrame.height let screenSize: CGRect = UIScreen.main.bounds let tabBarFrame = CGRect(x: 0, y: (screenSize.height - 88 + statusBarHeight), width: screenSize.width, height: 0) self.tabBar.frame = tabBarFrame } } The perfect position is 2 times a NavigationBar (2x 44 = 88) minus statusBarHeight. It works on iPhone 5S, 6, 7 Plus. Every time the same position. But why 2 times a NavigationBar (minus statusBarHeight) and is this the best approach?
Note: Below answer based on the conversation with question owner. From the Post: The perfect position is 2 times a NavigationBar (2x 44 = 88). It works on iPhone 5S, 6, 7 Plus. Every time the same position.But why 2 times a NavigationBar? SLPagingView bar is a custom UIView that acts like a sliding navigationBar.From your tabBarController.you programmatically hiding the status bar.. Calculation: According to your SLPagingView controller there is no navigationBar(44) and tabBar(44) thats make 2 x 44 = 88.. From your tabBarController calculation should be like below  UIApplication.shared.statusBarFrame.height + UINavigationController().navigationBar.frame.height + UINavigationController().toolbar.frame.height + tailingSpace between the barView to tabBar(8 as he mentioned)
