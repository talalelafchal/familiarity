(MatLab) Count number of occurrences in array and check if bigger than parameter
<p>I am a new user of MatLab and I am stuck with a simple task. I have an array made of 0s and 1s: I need to check if 1s occur more than X time consecutively. i.e. A = [ 0 1 1 1 0 1 0 1 1 1 1 0 1] and I need to know if I have 4 (for example) consecutive 1s in the array ( it only needs to happen once for me to go on with what I am trying to do). If the condition is verified I will then create a new variable, e.g. Y, and set equal to 1 and continue with my script.</p> <p>Thank you for the help</p>
<p>This should do the job: The while loop cuts a vector with 4 elements from the array and compares it to a vector with 4 elements and only ones. If a vector of 4 consecutive ones is contained in A, the variable four_consecutive_ones_found will be set to 1, otherwise it will return 0.</p> <pre><code>A=[0 1 1 1 0 0 0 1 1 1 0 1 1 1 1]; b=[1 1 1 1]; bool = 0 i_start=1 i_end=4 while bool==0 C=A(i_start:i_end) if C==b four_consecutive_ones_found = 1; bool = 1 else i_start=i_start+1 i_end=i_end+1 if i_end &gt; numel(A) &amp;&amp; bool == 0 bool =2 four_consecutive_ones_found = 0; end end end four_consecutive_ones_found </code></pre>
