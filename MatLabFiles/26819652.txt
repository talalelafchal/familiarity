Matlab: animating the plot and fft
<p>I am currently working on a project that: plot the data -> take fft -> apply filter -> inverse fft -> plot out the result. </p> <p>The codes are already written out. However, because we are doing this for presentation, our audience would like to see some "dynamics" or animation with the matlab. </p> <p>Therefore, I am wondering if we could have any idea to facilitate this animation in matlab?</p> <pre><code>fileID = fopen('data.txt'); dataRead = textscan(fileID,'%f %f %f'); Fs=1000; Time=dataCol(:,1); Data=dataCol(:,2); figure; plot(Time,Data); frequency=(linspace(-0.5,0.5,length(Data))*Fs); F=fftshift(fft(Data)); figure; plot(frequency,abs(F)); %plot the magnitude frequency spectrum; %now apply filter; mask=zeros(1, length(F)); mask(length(F)/2-2 : length(F)/2+2)=1; New_F=mask.*F; %show the frequency spectrum after apply the filter. figure, plot(frequency, abs(New_F)); % do ifft; new_data=ifftshift(ifft(New_F)); plot (Time, new_data); </code></pre>
<p>Are the following any helpful to you?</p> <p>You can do <code>uiopen()</code> to interactively open file and get the filename. It will open a standard fileopen dialog box with folder locations. That will add some visual stuff in there. Also using <code>inputdlg("Plese enter bla bla bla")</code> will help you to get data using a text box. You can get Fs, Time, and Data from that. Also, once you proess the everything, display <code>msgbox("All done!")</code> to let users know that it's done.</p> <p>The other option will be simply design a GUI window where right half will display your plots and left-half will have all the text boxes to capture file name, data, etc. MATLAB GUI builder should be able to help you construct that in 5-6 minutes.</p>
