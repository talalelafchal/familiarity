Combine boxplot axies with polyfit lines axies in Matlab
<p>I am drawing a plot for a set of data, including a boxplot and a polyfit plot, but when I drew it, they had two different axies so that I could not compare them. How could I combine these two plots and make them into the same axies? (For example, move boxplot starting at 0) Thanks a lot!</p> <p><img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/h6qkw.png" alt="enter image description here"></p> <pre><code>.... figure(1) f=polyfit(selectedKhwv,DiffVesKhwv,n); x= min(selectedKhwv):0.001:max(selectedKhwv); y=vpa(poly2sym(f),10); y=vectorize(y); y=eval(y); plot(x,y,'-r'); hold on; boxplot(DiffVesKhwv,selectedKhwv); axis([0,14,-6,8]); </code></pre>
