Aligning 3D Nifty image volumes from multiple subjects
<p>I have 3D Nifty image volumes for multiple patients and in different time intervals. Which means, each patient has number of image volumes which were scanned at different times.</p> <p>I have to take some measurements in these images. But I have 2 concerns. 1) When considering a single patient, patient position can be different at each time 2) each patient's position can be different to each other Therefore, it will be hard to compare the measurements, if I measure them as it is.</p> <p>I want to align them, so that I can take the measurements int the same plane.</p> <p>I know I have to do some kind of registration to align the images. But I don't understand a way to do that?</p>
