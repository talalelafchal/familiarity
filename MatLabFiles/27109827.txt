find word occurrences in matrix matlab
<p>I have a big matrix which cells represent the number of occurrences of a word (row) in a text document (column).</p> <pre><code>counts = rand(567840,799); % 567840 words,799 text documents </code></pre> <p>Without executing a loop I need to:</p> <p>1) extract the indeces of the words that occurr in at least the 90% of the text documents</p> <p>2) extract the indeces of the words that occour max 2 times in all the collection of documents.</p> <p>for the point 2 I would do</p> <pre><code>idx_2 = find(sum(counts,2)&lt;=2); </code></pre> <p>I am struggling with point 1... Can you help me?</p>
<p>For 1 you can do</p> <pre><code>idx1 = find(mean(counts &gt; 0, 2) &gt;= 0.9); </code></pre> <p>and for 2 as you said</p> <pre><code>idx2 = find(sum(counts, 2) &lt;= 2); </code></pre> <p><em>Edit</em> - I see Luis Mendo already mentioned this in the comments so I have marked this community wiki.</p>
