How do I designate y as a vector of 2 functions in Matlab?
<p>I am trying to create a for loop to run through my program and call out a function program I have created. I have been successful in getting it to run but now I would like to simplify it one more step and shorten my program by defining y as a vector of two functions instead of y1 and y2. I tried creating a 2 cell array with the functions inside but this is a failed effort. Here is what I have.</p> <pre><code>f =cell(size(a)); f(1) =[@(t) 4*t]; f(2) =[@(t) 20+(5-t).^2]; </code></pre> <p>Any advice on organizing these 2 into a vector for a single input of y?</p>
<p>What if you use a cell array instead:</p> <pre><code>f =cell(2,1); f(1) ={@(t) 4*t}; %// Note the curly braces f(2) ={@(t) 20+(5-t).^2}; </code></pre> <p>OR using the following, which is more intuitive using cell arrays (thanks @rayryeng!). Assign the content of the cell with curly braces instead of doing the opposite as above.</p> <pre><code>f{1} =@(t) 4*t; f{2} =@(t) 20+(5-t).^2; celldisp(f) f{1} = @(t)4*t f{2} = @(t)20+(5-t).^2 </code></pre>
<p>Another possibility would be to define a vector-valued function whose components are your two functions:</p> <pre><code>f1 = @(t) 4*t; f2 = @(t) 20+(5-t).^2; f = @(t) [f1(t) f2(t)]; </code></pre> <p>So for example</p> <pre><code>&gt;&gt; f(2.5) &gt;&gt; ans = 10.0000 26.2500 </code></pre>
