Grayscale image and L*a*b space in MATLAB
<p>I have a bunch of images, the vast majority of which are color (rgb) images. I need to apply some spatial features in the three different channels of their Lab color space. The conversion from RGB Color space to Lab color space is straightforward through <code>rgb2gray</code>. However, this naturally fails when the image is grayscale (consists of one channel only, with the numerical representation being a <code>double</code>, <code>uint8</code>, anything really).</p> <p>I am familiar with the fact that the "luminance" (L) channel of the Lab color space is essentially the grayscaled original RGB image. This question, however, is of a different nature; what I'm asking is: Given an image that is already grayscale, I trivially get the L channel in Lab color space. <strong>What should the a and b channels be</strong>? Should they be zero? The following example, using the pre-build "peppers" image, shows the visual effect of doing so:</p> <pre><code>I = imread('peppers.png'); figure; imshow(I, []); Lab = rgb2gray(I); Lab(:, :, 2) = 0; Lab(:, :, 3) = 0; figure; imshow(Lab, []); </code></pre> <p>If you run this code, you will note that the second <code>imshow</code> outputs a reddish version of the first image, resembling an old dark room. I admit to not being knowledgeable about what the a and b color channels represent in order to understand how I should deal with them in grayscale images, and was looking for some assistance.</p>
