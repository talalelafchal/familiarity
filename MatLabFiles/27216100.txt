Matlab linear models for all elements in a matrix
<p>I am writing a function which have to run ~2 Million linear models. The data will be taken from a CSV file and the model has to be specified by a string (similar to model descriptions supported by Matlab using the column names as variables).</p> <p>I have got it worked out, using Matlab's <code>fitlm</code> function. But the operation takes more than 24 hours to complete. (I even used <code>parfor</code> loops to speedup but the overhead for that - including having ~2 Million linear models in a cell structure caused it to slow down more.)</p> <p>Do you know any built-in function that I will be able to use it for my linear models which will make this process faster??</p> <p>All your opinions and suggests are welcome. Thanks. </p>
