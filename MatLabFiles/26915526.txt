Wait for cftool to close, then continue execution
<p>I'd like to call the cftool from a function/script, do my fitting, store the variables to the workspace and then resume execution of my function. Naively, one could assume that assigning a handle to the GUI and then using waitfor(), like for a graphics object, would do the job, but that was a bit short-sighted. Minimally this reads</p> <pre><code>h = cftool; waitfor(h); disp('happy fitting'); </code></pre> <p>and of course does not work.</p> <p>Cheers.</p>
<p>The <code>cftool</code> does not return a handle, so you need to search for it using <code>findall</code>:</p> <pre><code>cftool f = findall(0,'Type','Figure'); waitfor(f(1)) disp('Happy fitting!') </code></pre> <p>If you have multiple figures <code>f</code> may have multiple values and it could cause some issues. So keep track of your figures and check which position has the gui handle, before you call <code>waitfor</code>.</p>
