interpolation of 3D surface in matlab
<p>I have 3 dimensional (X-Y-Z) data which includes- </p> <p>11 <code>Y</code> vectors (<code>100*1</code> each (range <code>0:0.01:1</code>)) each is unique and correspond to the same <code>X</code> vector (<code>100*1</code> (range <code>0:0.01:1</code>)). Thus, <code>Y</code> can be treated as matrix with dimension <code>100*11</code>.</p> <p>Different <code>Y</code> vectors correspond to different <code>Z</code> values on Z axis (11 values of <code>Z</code> ranging from <code>0</code> to <code>1</code>). </p> <p>e.g. => Every value of <code>Z</code> on Z axis i.e. <code>Z1=0.05 ... Z11=0.95</code> has different <code>Y</code> vector for the same <code>X</code> vector. Thus it is like: <code>X-Y1-Z1</code>, <code>X-Y2-Z2</code>, <code>X-Y3-Z3...X-Y11-Z11</code> (<code>Z1</code> to <code>Z11</code> are fixed values like <code>0.05</code>, <code>0.1 ,..., 0.95</code> which are repeated equal to the length of <code>X</code> and <code>Y</code>).</p> <p>I have already plotted this data as 11 discrete contour lines stacked one above other in 3D space using plot3 hold on. But, I want to create surface out of it. I think I can use interpolation using <code>griddata</code> but I didn't understand how to approach this problem. Can anybody help? </p>
