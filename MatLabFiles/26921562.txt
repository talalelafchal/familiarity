How to iterate through array and get row elements for each row in array - Matlab
<p>I need help assigning row elements in an array to a new variable using a for loop. e.g.</p> <pre><code>y = magic(2) for i = size(y,1) m = y(i,:) % do some calculations to row vector 'm' and then iterate to next row vector and replace previous 'm' with new 'm' and perform same calculations end </code></pre> <p>Thanks in advance for your help.</p>
<p>A little more direct: <a href="http://es.mathworks.com/help/matlab/ref/for.html" rel="nofollow"><code>for</code></a> automatically iterates along <em>columns</em> of a matrix; so you can use:</p> <pre><code>y = magic(2); for row = y.' %'// transpose y, and iterate through the columns of that %// 'row' contains each row of y, but as a column vector. Transpose if needed end </code></pre>
<p>It looks that your problem is the for loop, you are missing the initial value for the iterator <code>i</code>:</p> <pre><code>y = magic(2) for i = 1:size(y,1) m = y(i,:) % use m end </code></pre>
