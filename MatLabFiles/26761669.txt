Matlab profiling
<p>I'm trying to speed up my code in Matlab through profiling. I have two questions:</p> <p>1) when I call the profile report I get a list of functions; most of them are not explicitly called by my code (e.g. <code>workspacefunc</code>); how can I see to which lines of my code they are referred?</p> <p>2) What is the function <code>workspacefunc</code>?</p>
<p>If you do anything else between <code>profile on</code> and <code>profile viewer</code> except run the code you're trying to check, other actions you take will also be included in the profiler.</p> <p>For example, running the standard example:</p> <pre><code>profile on plot(magic(35)) profile viewer </code></pre> <p>Should show you that most of the time is actually consumed by <code>setdiff</code> (if ordered by Self Time). <code>workspacefunc</code> is not listed.</p> <p>If after calling <code>plot(magic(35))</code>, you then go to the plot and zoom in a bit, then call <code>profile viewer</code>, you will see that some functions related to <code>zoom</code> are now in the list. The code itself, of course, doesn't actually <code>zoom</code> anything.</p> <p>And if after calling <code>plot(magic(35))</code>, you double-click on a variable in the Workspace browser, then run <code>profile viewer</code>, you will see <code>workspacefunc</code>, and a bunch of other things which weren't there before, appear in the list.</p>
