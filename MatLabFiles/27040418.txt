How to add title for a graph according to user selection in Matlab
<p>I open a dialog box for the user to choose a parameter and I create a graph according to this parameter. The user can choose one or more parameters out of the list in the dialog box and if the user chose more than one parameter all the plots will be in the same graph (different color for each plot) </p> <p>now I would like to add a title to the graph according to the user selection (for example if the user chose parameter A the title should be: A, and if the user chose multiple parameters the title should be: A + B + ...) Is it possible? and how?</p>
<p>Here is some code which seem to do what you are after; I once wanted to do something similar and it worked fine for me, hopefully it's the case for you. I put comments so it should be quite easy to follow/reproduce for your application.</p> <pre><code>clear clc %// Generate dummy data x = 1:10; y1 = 3*x-2; y2 = x.^2/2; y3 = x + rand(1,10); %// Store data in a cell in a cell array. Easy to access in a loop. DataCell = {y1;y2;y3}; %// Do the same for the plot properties, title and legend entries. ColorCell = {'b';'--r';'+-g'}; LegendCell = {'Dataset 1';'Dataset 2';'Dataset 3'}; TitleCell = {'Dataset 1';'Dataset 2';'Dataset 3'}; %// Setup dialog box for data selection SelectionString = {'y1' 'y2' 'y3'}; [selection,~] = listdlg('PromptString','Select data to plot','ListString',SelectionString); TitleString = ''; %Initialize TitleString, which is updated in the loop. %// Plot data hold on for k = selection plot(x,DataCell{k},ColorCell{k}) TitleString = [TitleString '+' TitleCell{k}]; end TitleString(1) = [];%// Remove the first character. title(TitleString) legend(LegendCell{selection},'location','best') hold off </code></pre> <p>Sample plot:</p> <p><img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/GUD9S.jpg" alt="enter image description here"></p> <p>Hope that helps.</p>
