Forcing homogeneous output in matlab
<p>As part of an assignment related to graphics, I have to solve the simple equation Ax=b. In this equation, A is a known 2x3 matrix, b is a known 2x1 vector, and x is the unknown 3x1 vector, which has to be homogeneous.</p> <p>Now, I know of the standard MATLAB solution x = A\b; However, this does not force x to be homogeneous. Is there a way I can force the third element of x to be 1?</p>
<p>To force the third element of x to be 1, add an equation that says "x<sub>3</sub>=1". That is, add row <code>[0 0 1]</code> to the matrix and corresponding entry <code>1</code> to the vector <code>b</code>. Like this: </p> <pre><code>x = [A; 0 0 1] \ [b; 1] </code></pre> <h3>Example</h3> <pre><code>A = [1 2 4; 3 4 5]; b = [6; 7]; </code></pre> <p>Simply entering <code>A\b</code> returns <code>[-0.2857; 0; 1.5714]</code>. </p> <p>But <code>[A; 0 0 1] \ [b; 1]</code> returns <code>[-2; 2; 1]</code>.</p>
