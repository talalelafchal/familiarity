Matrix Indexing with larger matrix
<p>I'm trying to understand some old code from a predecessor and I'm having some problems with a certain kind of matrix indexing:</p> <p>I have a large matrix <code>A</code> that has labelled regions (neighboring elements that share a number) Now I have a second matrix <code>B=[0 1 2 3 ... n]</code> with <code>n</code> being the number of elements Then we access <code>output = B(A+1)</code>.<br> Now I don't really get what happens when I try to index a smaller matrix with a larger one. And then I don't see that <code>output</code> is any different from my matrix <code>A</code>.</p> <p>Anybody can help me with my confusion? Thanks!</p>
<p>Indexing a small vector using a large matrix is a (nice) way of performing a look-up-table operation: that is <code>output</code> is generated by replacing each element of <code>A</code> by the element <code>B(A+1)</code> the result is the same size as <code>A</code>.<br> In your particular example, since <code>B( A(ii,jj)+1 ) == A(ii,jj)</code> for all <code>ii</code> and <code>jj</code>, this specific look-up operation is meaningless.</p> <p>You can try different <code>B</code> vectors and see how that change influence <code>output</code>.</p>
