Matlab: return complete solution of inverse cosine (acos)
<p>I have some Matlab code of the following form:</p> <p><code>syms theta x theta = acos(x)</code></p> <p>This returns a single solution for theta. However, I want to return the complete solution (between some limits). </p> <p>For example,</p> <p>x = cos(theta) </p> <p>would give x=0.5 for theta = 60 degrees, 120 degrees, 420 degrees, etc. Therefore, in my code above, I want theta to return all these possible values.</p> <p>Does anyone know how to do this? I have been searching google for hours but I can't find how to do this!</p> <p>Many thanks!</p>
<p>You just have to use a loop:</p> <pre><code>for x = limit_inf:step:limit_sup theta(x) = acos(x); end </code></pre> <p>And also define your limits and the step between them. </p>
<p>Here's a numerical solution; like Benoit_11 I don't see the point of doing it symbolically in this context.</p> <p>There are two solutions within the interval [-pi, pi], the larger one being returned by <code>acos</code>:</p> <pre><code>% solution within [0, pi] theta1 = acos(x); % solution within [-pi, 0] theta2 = -acos(x); </code></pre> <p>These solutions repeat at steps of 2 pi. The number of possible steps downwards and upwards can be determined by the integer part of the distance between the basic solution and the respective limit (<code>lower</code> and <code>upper</code>), in units of 2 pi. For <code>theta1</code>:</p> <pre><code>% repetitions in 2 pi intervals within limits sd = floor((theta1 - lower) / (2 * pi)); su = floor((upper - theta1) / (2 * pi)); theta1 = (-sd : su) * 2 * pi + theta1 </code></pre> <p>And the same for <code>theta2</code>:</p> <pre><code>% repetitions in 2 pi intervals within limits sd = floor((theta2 - lower) / (2 * pi)); su = floor((upper - theta2) / (2 * pi)); theta2 = (-sd : su) * 2 * pi + theta2 </code></pre> <p>If you'd like one combined list of solutions, excluding possible duplicates:</p> <pre><code>theta = unique([theta1, theta2]) </code></pre> <p>and in degrees:</p> <pre><code>theta = theta / pi * 180; </code></pre> <hr> <p>Example:</p> <pre><code>x = 0.5; lower = -10; upper = 30; </code></pre> <p>gives</p> <pre><code>theta = -7.3304 -5.2360 -1.0472 1.0472 5.2360 7.3304 11.5192 13.6136 17.8024 19.8968 24.0855 26.1799 </code></pre>
