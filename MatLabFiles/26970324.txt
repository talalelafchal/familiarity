m_line boundary for stereographic map
<p><img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/S9TuL.png" alt="enter image description here">Using M_map package for Matlab, I have created a stereographic projection map of the Arctic. I went on further to create boundary to specify a certain area. Unfortunately, using m_line gives me a straight line from point to point when it should be a curved line. how do I fix this?</p> <pre><code>figure() m_proj('stereographic','lat',90,'rad',22,'lon',0) m_coast('patch',[.5 .5 .5],'edgecolor',[0 0 0]); hold m_grid ('box', 'fancy', 'ytick',(70:5:90)); [cs,h]=m_tbase('contour',[-250 -1000 -2000 -3000], 'edgecolor', 'k', 'linewidt', 0.00001); [LongitudeProj, LatitudeProj]=m_ll2xy(longitude, latitude); bndry_lon=[0 125 125 0 0 ]; bndry_lat=[86 86 90 90 86 ]; m_line(bndry_lon,bndry_lat,'linewi',2,'color','g'); </code></pre> <p>The green line in the image attached is how the code draws the m_line... but the brown line is how it should be drawn since it is a stereographic projection.</p>
<p>I think the function is just made to find points on a map, and connect them with a straight line (As you currently see happening).</p> <p>A way to get what you want might be to work around this with a polygon that consists of many points, for example:</p> <pre><code>bndry_lon=[linspace(0,125,100) 125 0 0 ]; bndry_lat=[linspace(86,86,100) 90 90 86 ]; </code></pre> <p>If you believe the function is capable of producing the curved line that you seek directly, please find/create a simple example so we can pick it up from there.</p>
