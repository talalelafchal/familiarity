Matlab handling values after getting them in edit text
<p>I have a little GUI, built with the MATLAB guide. It has a few edit text, where i set the values of my parameters. After clicking the "run" button at the bottom, a function should be called with the parameters, that are set in those edit texts. What is the easiest way to do that? Im not sure about accessing the data.</p> <p>Thanks a lot for your help!</p> <p>Greets, R93</p>
<p>MATLAB will generate a callback function for your "run" button in the m-file of your GUI:</p> <pre><code>function yourpushbutton_Callback(hObject, eventdata, handles) </code></pre> <p>where <code>handles</code> is a structure containing all handles of the GUI. You can get the parameters from the <code>edit text</code> fields and call your function in this callback function. To get the text, use</p> <pre><code>text = get(handles.edittext1,'String'); </code></pre>
<p>I found out that i could set it with</p> <pre><code>maxRPM = str2double(get(hObject,'String')); set(handles.editMaxRPM, 'Double', maxRPM); </code></pre>
