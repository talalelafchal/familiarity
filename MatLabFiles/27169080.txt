How to match two images whether there patterens are same or not?
<p>I want to know about that for example i have two images and wants to compare whether they are same or not i searched about it but didn't get any satisfying result also which tool or platform is better for it MATLAB, MATHEMATICA, JAVA etc and their integration with you website. </p> <p>Thanks in advance</p>
<p>Proposed Steps:</p> <ol> <li>Load images</li> <li>Extract features (color, edges locations, corner points, gabor jets)</li> <li>Define similarity measure</li> <li>Compute similarity score between features</li> </ol> <p>This is just a quick tip to get start with some literature... Regarding the platform I would suggest to download the library opencv in c++</p> <p><a href="http://opencv.org/" rel="nofollow">http://opencv.org/</a></p> <p>good luck</p>
