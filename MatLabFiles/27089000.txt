How to convert uncompressed (*.LJPGEG.1) images of DDSM database into PNG format for all scanners
<p>I am working on breast cancer detection in Mammogram Images. Recently, I have downloaded some images(<em>.LJPEG) of DDSM database and converted them to uncompressed format (</em>.LJPEG.1) by using source codes given on site <a href="http://marathon.csee.usf.edu/Mammography/Database.html" rel="nofollow">http://marathon.csee.usf.edu/Mammography/Database.html</a>. Now, I want to convert uncompressed (*.LJPEG.1) to *.PNG format. But, it gives very less contrast as Original images are 12 bit images and converted images are written as 16 bit images. I have used following code to do it</p> <pre><code>fid = fopen('h:\C_0018_1.LEFT_CC.LJPEG.1','r','ieee-be'); image = fread(fid,[ row , col],'short'); image = image'; image = uint16(image); </code></pre> <p>As described in the paper <a href="http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/summary?doi=10.1.1.111.3846" rel="nofollow">http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/summary?doi=10.1.1.111.3846</a> when properly compiled, the DDSM software outputs the image data as a stream of raw bytes; <strong>one then has to normalise these according to the model of digitiser used to image the original films and then create an image file that is readable by one’s image analysis software environment</strong>. Can anybody tell me how to do it?</p>
<p>I have written a small utility to easily download, convert, view and get annotations from DDSM data, without the need for any manual work. The utility makes getting the DDSM database totally automatic, and is designed to help researchers. You just need to download the required cases and then follow the instructions on how to use my utility to convert the LJPEG files to LJPEG1 and then to other formats like PNG, JPEG, TIF, GIF etc. The images are also normalized according to their respective scanners. </p> <p>You can download my utility from here - <a href="https://github.com/trane293/DDSMUtility" rel="nofollow">https://github.com/trane293/DDSMUtility</a> </p> <p>EDIT: Version 2 of my utility takes care of normalization procedure. This has been achieved by reusing the jpeg.exe and ddsmraw2pnm.exe files supplied by DDSM-Software author Dr. Chris Rose. </p> <p>Moreover, this version is now MATLAB and Windows based only, as compared to the older one which used both Linux and Windows to run. The whole utility works from MATLAB, and you just need to edit the paths in the scripts to make it run on your system. </p> <p>I can write a full fledged tutorial here, but it will be very lengthy. So I included a very detailed Tutorial.pdf file in the GitHub repository for a step by step tutorial to using the utility. </p>
