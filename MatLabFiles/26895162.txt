MATLAB: how to plot a function with a matrix?
<p>For an exercise at school, I'm trying to plot a function where the variable is a matrix.<br> The function is very simple: y=x^4<br> The matrix, x, is 0:0.01:20 so it has a range from 0 to 20, and there are 2000 between them.<br> My problem is, the scale of the x-axis is 0-2000, and not 0-20 as i'd suppose it to be.<br> According to the current graph: 1000^4=10000, while it should be: 10^4=10000.<br> What am I doing wrong? </p>
<p>If I understand your question correctly, this is how it should be done. To limit the range of the x-axis and y-axis: use these commands</p> <pre><code>ylim([minimumvalue maxvalue]); xlim([minimumvalue maxvalue]); </code></pre> <p>Here is the answer to your question:</p> <pre><code>x = 0:0.01:20 ; y =x.^4; % plot function plot(x,y); title('My function') xlabel('X-axis range') xlim([0 20]) ![OUTPUT][1] </code></pre>
