MATLAB: Access variables of a script in a function
<p>This is a very basic question, but somehow, I am struck up with this.</p> <p>Suppose there is a script</p> <blockquote> <p>Script1.m</p> </blockquote> <pre><code>a = 1; b = 2; function1() </code></pre> <p>And a function, function1 in function1.m</p> <blockquote> <p>function1.m</p> </blockquote> <pre><code>a = a/b; end </code></pre> <p>Now when I run this, I get an error: 'Undefined function or variable "a".</p> <p>I am familiar with C/C++, and I know that I can pass a, b as arguments to the function. But suppose 'a' contains a lot of data , which if passed through the function would consume a lot of time. So it won't be feasible to pass the variable.</p> <p>Is there any other approach to achieve the same?</p> <p><strong>Edit 1:</strong> Suppose I am using Pattern Search, or some other function which takes a function1 handle as an argument, then how do I pass variables local to script1 to function1.</p>
