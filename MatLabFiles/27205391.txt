how do i differentiate array values in octave?
<p>i'm implementing assignment that i have ECG signal as one dimensional array file input, do some processing in order to detect heart rate.</p> <p>first step is too differentiate values using 5 point difference equation to get rid of low frequency values, I've searched about differentiation in octave but all I found is about polynomials. so how do I implement this in octave/mat-lab commands? </p> <p>thanks</p>
<p>You can use <code>Pan-Tompkins</code> method on R-peak detection,</p> <p><code>ecgSig</code> being your ECG signal with sampling frequency <code>Fs</code>,</p> <pre><code>t=(0:size(ecgSig,2)-1)/Fs; ecgSig = circshift(ecgSig,[0 5]) - ecgSig; subplot(211) plot(t,ecgSig); subplot(212) plot(t,ecgSig); </code></pre> <p><img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/go89j.png" alt="enter image description here"></p>
<p>According to my experience, maybe you want to compute the slope (an approximation of the derivative) of your signal using 5 points, this can be easly achived using for example:</p> <pre><code>load ecg; n=5 for i=n+1:length(ecg) Y(i-n) = (ecg(i) - ecg(i-n))/n; end subplot(2,1,1); plot(ecg) subplot(2,1,2); plot(Y) </code></pre> <p>Is this the result you expect? <img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/8byzE.jpg" alt="enter image description here"></p>
