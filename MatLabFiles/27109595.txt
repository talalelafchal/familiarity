How to set correct 32 bit dependencies for mexw32 file
<p>I am constructing a 32bit .mexw32 from a cpp file in Matlab 32 bit on windows 7 64bit os. Although it is successfully generated to file, when I run it I get the error <code>Invalid MEX-file 'PCLview_organised.mexw32': The specified module could not be found.</code></p> <p>With Dependency Walker I realize that it resorts to 64bit dll's instead of 32 which results in compatibility issues. <img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/JWP76.png" alt="enter image description here"> How can this be fixed ??? I have unsucessfully tried adding the windows/syswow64 to environment variables but somehow, the 64 bit dll's still get picked up.</p>
