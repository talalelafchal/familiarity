Selecting the vector with the largest sum Matlab
<p>I'm looking for a way to select the vector that has the largest sum. Is there a simple way of doing this? I was thinking of writing a loop, but I'm not sure how to loop over a set of vectors.</p> <p>Thanks for your help!</p>
<p>For the case in which the vectors have the same length (as stated in the comment), I think a simple loop-free way would be to build a matrix from each vector and fetch directly the row (or column) with the largest sum:</p> <pre><code>clear clc RandMat = rand(8,10); [~,Ind] = max(sum(RandMat,2)); %// Get row index for largest sum. If you want the column, use 1 instead. MaxRow = RandMat(Ind,:); %// Index in original matrix to get the vector. If you want the column, use RandMat(:,Ind); </code></pre> <p>If vectors don't have the same length then you would need to pad the missing values with NaN for example to use a regular matrix, otherwise you would need a cell array.</p> <p>If you prefer a solution in which you don't have to build a matrix then you could loop through each individual vector and store the sum in a variable, then compare the sums at the end. If you would like such a solution please ask!</p>
