How to find a sub-sample image from the main image to find gabor filter orientations so as to reduce processing time?
<p>I'm trying to find the dominant orientations on an image that is 640 * 480. In general the gabor filter kernel is convolved with all the pixels resulting in a numerically intensive operation. So I wanted to sub-sample the image and find it like in this picture. I'm using matlab for the processing.</p> <p><img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/ENsAz.png" alt="enter image description here"></p> <p>Some ideas I had in mind was,</p> <ol> <li>Use <code>imresize(img,[160,160]);</code> and resize the image to 160*160.</li> <li>Use <code>downsample</code>function of matlab. Which do you think, will be best for my purpose?</li> </ol> <p>This is the paper I'm working out. <a href="http://pdf.aminer.org/000/128/869/grouping_dominant_orientations_for_ill_structured_road_following.pdf" rel="nofollow noreferrer">http://pdf.aminer.org/000/128/869/grouping_dominant_orientations_for_ill_structured_road_following.pdf</a></p>
