Stepsize control of ODE45 and ODE23s
<p>I'm trying to figure out the order of convergence for my exact problem using both ode45 and ode23s in matlab. </p> <p>To do so i'm using</p> <pre><code>options = odeset('InitialStep',dt,'RelTol',Inf,'AbsTol',Inf,'MaxStep',dt,'Stats','on'); [~,y] = ode23s(@funode,[time(1):dt:time(end)],init,options); </code></pre> <p>to control the step size. </p> <p>This works just fine on the problems I have tested it on for ode23s, but of some reasons not for ode45. Were I just lucky that it worked on ode23s? what am I doing wrong? or why is it not working on ode45?</p>
