My Simulink model is printing callbacks to the diagnostic window, how do i print to the command window?
<p>I have a start function callback in my Simulink model. Right now it prints everything to the diagnostic window. I have tried disp, display and fprintf. Is there a setting somewhere to make the default print to the command window instead?</p> <p><img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/6INqD.png" alt="enter image description here"> <img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/bvKWS.png" alt="enter image description here"> <img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/XrPNi.png" alt="enter image description here"></p>
<p>It looks the default behaviour is now to print to the diagnostics window and there's no setting to override this. Your only option is probably to use <a href="http://uk.mathworks.com/help/matlab/ref/evalin.html" rel="nofollow"><code>evalin</code></a>:</p> <pre><code>evalin('base','disp(''hi there'')') </code></pre> <p>You can probably create a <a href="http://uk.mathworks.com/support/servicerequests/index.html" rel="nofollow">Service Request</a> asking for this to be a future enhancement. MathWorks will probably want to know the reason for doing this though to justify the development effort and prioritise it against other features.</p>
