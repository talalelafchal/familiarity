Calling functions &amp; scripts in Matlab/Octave
<p>How do call a script to a function and vica versa in Matlab/Octave? </p> <pre><code>function mean_DNA_Microarray = Calc_mean_DNA_Microarray(M) M = DNA_Microarray mean_DNA_Microarray = M - ones(5,25)*mean(M(:,25)) end </code></pre> <p>The response is</p> <blockquote> <p>error: invalid call to script C:\Users\Nacho\Documents\Matlab\DNA_Microarray.m error: called from: error: C:\Users\Nacho\Documents\Matlab\Calc_mean_DNA_Microarray.m at line 3, column 3</p> </blockquote> <p>Now this will work if I call <code>DNA_Microarray</code> a function, but the problem requires that it remain as a script.</p>
<p>First of all, you are not defining your function correctly, as the function does not know what <code>M</code> is (unless it is a global vairable, but I doubt so).</p> <p>In ANY programming language, you need to tell a function which variables it is going to work with. This is not Matlab specific. In Matlab you will do it so:</p> <pre><code>function mean_DNA_Microarray = Calc_mean_DNA_Microarray(M) % Look! we are telling him what M is! mean_DNA_Microarray = M - ones(5,25)*mean(M(:,25)) end </code></pre> <p>Then you want to all the function from somewhere else you would need to just type its name and pass in the <em>arguments</em>, in this case what inside the function is going to be called <code>M</code></p> <pre><code>clear; clc; % Test code Mnameoutofthefunction=rand(100,100); DNAmean = DNA_Microarray(Mnameoutofthefunction); % here we are calling it! </code></pre> <p>Remember to save the function as functionname.m , in your case DNA_Microarray.m , else Matlab wont know which one it is.</p> <p>But I HIGHLY recommend you to read a book about Matlab or just about programming in general, as it seems like you could benefit from some basic introduction.</p> <p>Following @am304 suggestion, here you can find nice tutorials: </p> <p><a href="http://www.mathworks.co.uk/academia/student_center/tutorials/" rel="nofollow">http://www.mathworks.co.uk/academia/student_center/tutorials/</a></p> <p><strong>EDIT</strong> What you want to do is create a function as follows:</p> <pre><code>function mean_DNA_Microarray = Calc_mean_DNA_Microarray(M) % Look! we are telling him what M is! mean_DNA_Microarray = M - ones(5,25)*mean(M(:,25)) end </code></pre> <p>And then, inside your function DNA_Microarray call Calc_mean_DNA_Microarray with the input M</p>
