Signal Spectrum MATLAB Syntax
<p>I have a little problem regarding MATLAB and its syntaxes. I'm trying to plot a spectrum regarding an AM-modulated signal.</p> <p>In my case the AM-modulation is defined as:</p> <p><code>y(t)=[1+m*x(t)]*cos(2*pi*fc*t)</code>, where fc=100 kHz and m=0.5</p> <p>Breaking y(t) in parts:</p> <pre><code>y(t)=cos(2*pi*fc*t)+m*x(t)*cos(2*pi*fc*t) </code></pre> <p>and now x(t) is cosine wave with an amplitude of 1 and frequency range from fx=[0-5000Hz]. So y(t) can be written as:</p> <pre><code>y(t)=cos(2*pi*fc*t)+m*cos(2*pi*fx*t)*cos(2*pi*fc*t) </code></pre> <p>Using the trigonometric identity, we can write y(t) as:</p> <pre><code>cos(x)cos(y)=1/2(cos(x-y)+cos(x+y)) y(t)=cos(2*pi*fc*t)+m/2*cos(2*pi*t(fc-fx))+m/2*cos(2*pi*t(fc+fx)) </code></pre> <p>Now when fx=[0,5000Hz], y(t) can be written as the sum of these harmonic waves:</p> <pre><code>y(t)=cos(2*pi*fc*t)+m/2*cos(2*pi*t(fc-0))+m/2*cos(2*pi*t(fc+0))+m/2*cos(2*pi*t(fc-1))+m/2*cos(2*pi*t(fc+1))... + m/2*cos(2*pi*t(fc-5000))+m/2*cos(2*pi*t(fc+5000)) </code></pre> <p>Now when writing this all down in MATLAB:</p> <pre><code>clear all; fc=100000; //base frequency Fs=250000; //sampling rate should be Fs&gt;2fc according to Nyquist criterion Ts=1/Fs; m=0.5; t = 0:Ts:1-Ts; fx= 0:1:5000; yt=cos(2*pi*fc*t)+m*0.5*cos(2*pi*t(fc-fx))+m*0.5*cos(2*pi*t(fc+fx)) // this is where all goes wrong plot(abs(fft(yt))); // I don't know if this is the correct way to plot it. </code></pre> <p>The program always states that there's an error in the line with yt, it complains something about matrix dimensions should agree. I really don't know how I can fix this prom, so any help or suggestions are really appreciated.</p>
<p>The reason why is because the dimensions of <code>t</code> and the dimensions of <code>fx</code> don't match. You need to make sure that both of the dimensions of <code>t</code> and <code>fx</code> match. Therefore, try changing <code>fx</code> to this to ensure that both arrays are the same size:</p> <pre><code>fx = 0:(numel(t)-1); </code></pre>
