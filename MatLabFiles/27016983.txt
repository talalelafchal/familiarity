How to find all lines in a set that coincide in a single point?
<p>Suppose I am given a set of lines, how can I partition this set into a number of clusters, such that all the lines in each cluster coincide in a single point?</p>
<p>If number of lines N is reasonable, then you can use O(N^3) algorithm: for ever pair of lines (in form <code>A*x+B*y+C=0</code>) check whether they intersect - exclude pairs of parallel and not-coincident lines with determinant</p> <pre><code>|A1 B1| = 0 |A2 B2| </code></pre> <p>For every intersecting pair if another line shares the same intersecting point, with determinant:</p> <pre><code>|A1 B1 C1| |A2 B2 C2| = 0 |A3 B3 C3| </code></pre> <p>If N is too large for cubic algorithm using, then calculate all intersection points (upto O(N^2) of them) and add these points to any map structure (hashtable, for example). Check for matching points. Don't forget about numerical errors issue.</p>
