access to checkboxes within Matlab GUI
<p>I have a problem regarding the access to check boxes within Matlab uitable.I have a table in Matlab GUI that has a column of check boxes. I want to open a particular pdf file when a check box is clicked. But I can't find callback of the check boxes within the uitable. Hope the problem is statement is clear.</p> <p>thanks in advance, Abhirup</p>
<p>Create your own <a href="http://www.mathworks.com/help/matlab/ref/uitable-properties.html" rel="nofollow"><code>CellEditcallback</code></a> for your table.</p> <p>Take the following example:</p> <pre><code>function testcode % Initialize a basic GUI h.myfig = figure; % Initialize a dummy table cnames = {'a','b'}; cformat = {'char', 'logical'}; rnames = {'1','2'}; mydata = {'firstfile', false; 'secondfile', false}; h.mytable = uitable( ... 'Parent', h.myfig, ... 'CellEditCallback', @boxchecked, ... 'ColumnFormat', cformat, ... 'ColumnName', cnames, ... 'ColumnEdit', true, ... 'RowName', rnames, ... 'Data', mydata ... ); guidata(h.myfig,h); % Store handles for later end function boxchecked(hObject,eventdata) h = guidata(hObject); % Retrieve handles % Your code here end </code></pre> <p>Set a <a href="http://www.mathworks.com/help/matlab/matlab_prog/debugging-process-and-features.html" rel="nofollow">breakpoint</a> in the <code>boxchecked</code> function and look at the data given to you by <code>eventdata</code> (see also the <a href="http://www.mathworks.com/help/matlab/creating_guis/write-callbacks-using-the-programmatic-workflow.html" rel="nofollow">general callback documentation</a>). Three important fields are the <code>Indices</code> field, which gives you the cell that was edited and caused the callback to execute, and the <code>PreviousData</code> and <code>NewData</code> fields, which give you the before and after values of the edited cell. </p> <p>You'll also want to check to see whether or not the edited cell is a checkbox (<code>CellEditCallback</code> executes on any change to a cell in a table). Based on this data, decide what action(s) you want to take.</p>
