Determining the amplitude for a specific cycle (frequency) using a fast fourier transform
<p>I have been set an assignment using a dataset obtained from remote sensing on sea surface height anomaly. Before starting the question I'm having trouble with, I have loaded the data into matlab, filtered it so that it only contains data within the desired geographic location and plotted the data as a function of time. </p> <p>The question I'm struggling with specifically is: </p> <p>"Determine the amplitude of the annual cycle in the SSHA data at 36°, 21°W using fast Fourier transform."</p> <p>where SSHA is the sea surface height anomaly data. </p> <p>As I said above, I have filtered the data. I have also used the fast fourier transform command on the filtered data; fft(sshaFiltered) </p> <p>and plotted the absolute data; abs(sshaFilteredFft); plot(sshaFilteredAbs). </p> <p>This has enabled me to plot the data as a function of it's frequency (I believe). I just don't understand how to determine the amplitude of it's annual cycle. </p> <p>Any response is greatly appreciated, thank you.</p>
