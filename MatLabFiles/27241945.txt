find the edge based on normals
<p>I have a 480*640 depth image, and I got the normals (a 480*640*3 matrix) of each pixel from this depth image. Does anyone know how could I find the edge based on the normal information?</p> <p>Thanks a lot! </p>
<p>An intuitive definition of an edge in a depth image is where the surface normal faces away from the viewer. Assuming a viewing direction <code>[0 0 -1]</code> (into the XY plane) any normal that has nearly vanishing <code>z</code> component can be characterized as an edge.</p> <pre><code>e = abs( depth(:,:,3) ) &lt; 1e-3; %// a nice starting point </code></pre> <p>You need to set the threshold based on your data.</p> <p>After that you might consider applying some non-maximal suppression or other morphological cleaning operations.</p>
