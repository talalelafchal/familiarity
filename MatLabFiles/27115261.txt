MatLab - Error using run =&gt; Input argument is undefined
<p>As a MatLab newbie, I have problems running the following script:</p> <pre><code>function [ newarray ] = reshapeIm( array, period ) %reshapeIm(array, period) Summary of this function goes here % Detailed explanation goes here le = length(array); fra = le/period; array = [array, zeros(1, ceil(fra)*period-le)]; newarray = reshape(array', period, []); end load('1200rpm_shak3.mat'); cRounds = 54; mylength = 100; thetas = (1:cRounds*mylength).*2*pi/mylength; thetas0 = (1:mylength).*2*pi/mylength; figure; plot(z1(1:300), '.-'); plot(z2(1:300), '.-'); z1s = z1; z2s = [z2(mylength/4+1:end) z2(1:mylength/4)]; z3s = [z3(mylength/2+1:end) z3(1:mylength/2)]; z4s = [z4(mylength*3/4+1:end) z4(1:mylength*3/4)]; dr = 1/4.*(z1s+z2s+z3s+z4s); % gemittelt drs = reshapeIm(dr, mylength); drs_std = std(drs, 1, 2); drs_meanstd = mean(drs_std); figure; polar(thetas, 250000+200*dr); figure; polar(thetas0', 250000+200*mean(drs,2)); </code></pre> <p>The command window says: </p> <pre><code>??? Error using ==&gt; run Input argument 'array' is undefined. </code></pre> <p>I suppose, that's because the script was written for a newer MatLab, but I use 5.3.</p>
<p>Functions need to be in their own files. You cannot define functions within a script file. So, to get your code to work at all, you need to move the function that is at the top of your file (which I copied below) into its own file. Name the file "reshapeIM.m" and save it in the same directory where you are doing your work.</p> <pre><code>function [ newarray ] = reshapeIm( array, period ) %reshapeIm(array, period) Summary of this function goes here % Detailed explanation goes here le = length(array); fra = le/period; array = [array, zeros(1, ceil(fra)*period-le)]; newarray = reshape(array', period, []); end </code></pre> <p>Then, after removing the function from your script, save your script and run it again. This should solve the problem with regards to the function. You may have other errors, but this should take care of the error that you reported.</p>
