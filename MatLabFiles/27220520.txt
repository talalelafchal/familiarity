graphs similarity measure implementation
<p>I'm trying to find an appropriate similarity measure between two graphs. In fact, node label in my application are matrix (each row represent a particular feature histogram) and edge label are 0/1 (edge or no-edge between linked vertices). </p> <p>I read that graph edit distance is used for attributed graphs which I think is the case in my work. So, I tried to implement it, but I found several difficulties like the cost function definition in my case and the computational cost.</p> <p>So, is there a programming library or codes, perferably on MATLAB, that computes graph edit distances, or, once again, any other graph similarity measures, between two graphs?</p>
