Setting physical (screen) size of an axis in MATLAB
<p>I thought this problem would be trivial but I haven't been able to figure it out. I have two 3D figures, representing two data sets that are of different physical size (ie. one might represent something 10cm wide, one 20cm wide). I non-dimensionalize everything (so width goes from 0 to 1) and then I use daspect to change the aspect ratio of the plot so that the width appears to change between the plots, even though the axis limits do not (I set these to be constant).</p> <p>When I plot them, in different figures, however, MATLAB automatically scales the axis to fit in the figure. This means that my objects change size slightly, whilst I want them to keep the x and z scales exactly the same.</p> <p>Is there some way I can manually set how many pixels one unit of an axis takes up? You can see in the images that the scales on the z axis of the two figures are different, ie. the same length in zaxis units takes up different lengths in pixels.</p> <p><img src="http://s29.postimg.org/a6zy7tmfr/AM06.png" alt="Image 1" title="Image 1 - narrow"></p> <p><img src="http://s29.postimg.org/mkcseqc47/AM13.png" alt="Image 2"></p> <p>The code I used for the axes, view, and aspect ratio is:</p> <pre><code>xlim([-0.3 .6]) ylim([-.8 .8]) zlim([-0.2 1.3]) view([60 15]) daspect([1/268.3 1/(99.9730*width) 1/74]) </code></pre> <p>James</p>
