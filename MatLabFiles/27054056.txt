How to get a function from a edit box in matlab
<p>I have created a GUI in matlab with a edit box and the user should enter a function so the program may evaluate some values.</p> <p>However how do I retrieve the function in the textbox and how do I make the proper validations for example if the user enters "sin(coserewrwfc(x))"</p> <p>My code is:</p> <pre><code>f = get(handles.funcion,'String'); f =inline(f) f(0) </code></pre> <p>Thanks for your help</p>
<p>Here's one way of going about it. Basically it's the same as your code, but in a <code>try</code>/<code>catch</code> block so that if there is an error trying to do <code>f(0)</code>, the code will keep running. It will enter the <code>catch</code> statement, where you can manage the error, maybe by displaying a message box asking for the function to be entered again.</p> <pre><code>try f = inline(get(handles.funcion,'String')); f(0); %// try something that would fail if the function is defined incorrectly catch disp('There was a problem, please try again') end </code></pre>
