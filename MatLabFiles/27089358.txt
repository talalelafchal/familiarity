How to create a 2D array inside a 'for' loop in matlab
<p>I am new to matlab and I am trying to calculate ifft transform of vector Y for z=1:100.</p> <p>Here is the current version of the relevant part of the code (no array): </p> <pre><code>for z=1:100 Y=(exp(kx.^2))*(exp(i*z/2*k0)).*PSIX_0; psix_z=ifft(Y); end </code></pre> <p>where: PSIX_0 and kx are both 1x100 arays. k0 is a constant.</p> <p>All I can see now is the last row for z=100. Is there a way to recive a ifft of vector Y for each value of z?</p> <p>Thanks! </p>
<p>How about <code>psix_z(z,:) = ifft(Y);</code>? Or <code>psix_z(:,z)</code>, depending on whether the <code>ifft</code> is a row or column vector.</p>
