Calculate average from a series with fixed interval
<p>I have a time series with <code>12</code> data points x <code>n</code> sessions. All the values are in one column. </p> <p>I would like to average over all sessions so that I would get 1 series with only <code>12</code> data points. For instance, I could have:</p> <pre><code>[a1 a2 ... a12 b1 b2 ... b12 c1 c2 ... c12] </code></pre> <p>The outcome should be <code>[mean(a1, b1, c1) mean (a2, b2, c2)... mean(a12, b12, c12)]</code></p> <p>Could anyone help me do this efficiently in Matlab?</p> <p>Thank you!</p>
<p>The number of elements in your original series will always be a multiple of 12, so you can use <code>reshape()</code> to yield an 12 x n matrix. From there using <code>mean()</code> is straightforward to get the vector that you want. </p> <pre><code>nSessions = 20; % Choose an integer to test number of sessions TestData = 1:12; % Dummy data - col 1 = 1, col 2 = 2...to check that our reshaping is correct data = repmat(TestData, 1, nSessions); % Test data of the expected form reshapeData = reshape(data, 12, []); % Reshape into an 12 x N matrix; meanData = mean(reshapeData, 2); % Take mean along rows to yield desired answer </code></pre>
