find out rotation using phase correlation in matlab
<p>I just want to find out the rotation angle between two images (same images but only different thing is rotation) but I'm stuck in this problem for almost 3 weeks. The algorithm given at <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phase_correlation" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phase_correlation</a> is only using the radon transform and phase correlation method but it doesn't work. Anyone can help me?</p>
<p>Typically, this kind of problem is solved with a Fourier-Mellin algorithm, Matlab implementation <a href="http://www.mathworks.com/matlabcentral/fileexchange/3000-fourier-mellin-based-image-registration--with-gui-" rel="nofollow">here</a>.</p> <p>A potential approach is the use of a log-polar transform prior to phase correlation. The log-polar sampling maps changes in uniform scaling and rotation into translations along the radial and circumferential axes. See the complete description of the algorithm in this paper:</p> <blockquote> <p>Reddy, B. S. and Chatterji, B. N., An FFT-Based Technique for Translation, Rotation, and Scale-Invariant Image Registration, IEEE Transactions on Image Processing, Vol. 5, No. 8, August 1996</p> </blockquote> <p>If you have the image processing toolbox r2014a or later, there is a built-in function that does exactly that, it's called <a href="http://mathworks.com/help/images/ref/imregcorr.html" rel="nofollow"><code>imregcorr</code></a></p> <p>If you don't have the toolbox, you can <a href="http://fr.mathworks.com/matlabcentral/fileexchange/47238-impolar-m" rel="nofollow">download the function to map an image in polar coordinates</a> (for pure rotations). For scale and rotation, <a href="http://fr.mathworks.com/matlabcentral/fileexchange/27023-log-polar-image-sampling" rel="nofollow">here</a> is an implementation of the log-polar transform. </p>
