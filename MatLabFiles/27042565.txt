how to apply Differential Evolution algorithm to optimize
<p>i have an objective function that to be minimized is then formulated as:</p> <pre><code>fi =( 1/(x1+(1/2)*x2+(1/3)*x3+(1/4)*x4+(1/5)*x5+(1/6)*x6+(1/7)*x7)-x8 ) </code></pre> <p>the optimization is performed by <strong>a Differential Evolution Algorithm</strong> . In order to calculate fitness values, the following expression is used.</p> <pre><code>fitnessi=[1/fi] </code></pre> <p>where <strong>fitnessi</strong> is the <strong>fitness value of the ith solution</strong>. Once values of fitness are assigned for all vectors in the population, the vectors that produced the better fitness values are selected for the next generation.</p> <pre><code>%â€˜the maximum number of generations as the termination criteria = 400 % NP =150; :number of population members % D=32; :number of parameters of the objective % function % F =0.5; : DE-stepsize F ex [0, 2] % CR=0.4 : crossover probabililty constant ex [0, 1] % itermax =400; : maximum number of iterations (generations) % strategy =1; : 1 --&gt; DE/best/1 </code></pre> <p>i want to implement the objective function in MATLAB by '<a href="http://www1.icsi.berkeley.edu/~storn/devec.m" rel="nofollow">http://www1.icsi.berkeley.edu/~storn/devec.m</a>' .I have begun researching on Differential Evolution and am still finding it quite difficult in the implementation such as '3D-plot function 'part and the changes that i have to do according to my input in this code. please help me.</p>
