MAAB guideline : na_0002: Appropriate implementation of fundamental logical and numerical operations
<p>The MAAB guideline [na_0002: Appropriate implementation offundamental logical and numerical operations][1]. Indicates that logical data type shouldn't be used in numerical operations. Among the rationales listed, we can see Code generation, but i can't understand how using logical data type in numerical operations could affect negatively Code generation, since a cast is done for the logical data type ?</p> <p>Any help please.</p> <p>Regards</p>
<p>You shouldn't add, subtract, multiply or divide numbers by logicals (booleans). It just doesn't make sense.</p> <p>Should the result of a math operation with a logic operation give a numerical or a logical result, for example - it's ambiguous.</p>
