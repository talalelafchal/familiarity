Using Vision Caltech Camera Calibration toolbox for MATLAB
<p>I am currently using the camera calibration toolbox from vision caltech:<a href="http://www.vision.caltech.edu/bouguetj/calib_doc/htmls/example.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.vision.caltech.edu/bouguetj/calib_doc/htmls/example.html</a></p> <p>It has been good so far and I was able to obtain the camera parameters of my camera and everything using the checkered board.</p> <p>So now I have been taking pictures with my camera and I want to undistort them using the calibration results I obtained from the caltech calibration toolbox.</p> <p>The parameters are saved in a .mat file but I cannot find a way to use them on other images I took.</p> <p>Anyone knows how to do that?</p> <p>Thanks;</p>
<p>There is an <a href="http://www.mathworks.com/videos/camera-calibration-with-matlab-81233.html" rel="nofollow">easier way to calibrate cameras in MATLAB</a>. The Computer Vision System Toolbox also includes the <code>undistortImage</code> function, which is what you are looking for.</p>
