Displaying co-ordinates of points Matlab
<p>I want to display points in a 30x30 grid at random whenever my code is run, there are 10 points in total. The 10 points will be plotted in a area 30 by 30 defined as A1. x going from 0 to 30 and y going from 0 to 30. I want the coordinates of these 10 points</p> <pre><code> A1 = 30; % area defined as 30 X 30 grid N = 10; % 10 tags % Generate x and y position of tags for ii = 1:N xtemp = A1*rand(1,1); ytemp = A1*rand(1,1); end plot (xtemp,ytemp) grid on </code></pre> <p>When I run the code i get more than ten points, what i want is just 10 points on the graph and the co-ordinates of each random point chosen to be displayed. The code only seems to work when the matrix is not (1,1)</p>
<p>You don't need the loop. It is doing the same in each iteration, and you are only using the result of the last iteration.</p> <p>To plot individual points, use a mark such as <code>'.'</code> or <code>'o'</code>. This is passed as a third argument to <code>plot</code>: </p> <pre><code>A1 = 30; N = 10; xtemp = A1*rand(1,N); ytemp = A1*rand(1,N); plot(xtemp, ytemp, '.') grid on axis([0 A1 0 A1]) </code></pre> <p>To add text labels showing each point's coordinates:</p> <pre><code>xoffset = 0; yoffset = -1; fsize = 8; temp_str = mat2cell(num2str([xtemp(:) ytemp(:)], '(%.2f,%.2f)'), ones(1,N)); text(xtemp+xoffset, ytemp+yoffset, temp_str, 'fontsize', fsize) </code></pre> <p>You may want to change the format specifier <code>'(%.2f,%.2f)'</code>; <code>xoffset</code> and <code>yoffset</code> to control label position; and <code>fsize</code> to define font size. Note that it's likely that some labels partially overlap. You can reduce the chance of overlapping using smaller values of <code>fsize</code>.</p>
