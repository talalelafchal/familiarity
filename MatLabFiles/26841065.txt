How can I divide a vector into two equal vectors?
<p>I need to divide a vector into two equal vector in MATLAB. Could you help me please? For example if I have the vector <code>x=[1 3 7 9]</code> and I need two split it into <code>y=[1 3]</code> and <code>z=[7 9]</code>.</p>
<pre><code>function [v1, v2] = DivideVectorIntoTwo (v) midindex = floor (length (v) / 2) ; v1 = v (1:midindex) ; v2 = v (midindex+1 :end) ; end </code></pre>
<p>I would recommend to check out some basic matlab operations.</p> <p>if you take vector <code>x</code></p> <pre><code>x=1:1000; </code></pre> <p>you can easily split him into different new arrays. If you want to have to arrays with the same length you should use <code>numel()</code> or <code>size()</code> to get the size and then take half of it.</p> <pre><code>length_of_x=numel(x); new_length=ceil(length_of_x/2); </code></pre> <p>I used <code>ceil()</code> (rounding up) in case your x has not the length: 2,4,6,8 and so on but 1,3,5... Then you can use <code>1:new_length</code> to get the first half and <code>new_length+1:end</code> for the later half.</p> <pre><code>x1=x(1:new_length); x2=x(newlength+1:end); </code></pre> <p>would be the result for your task. </p>
<p><code>end</code> is a clever command in MATLAB that can be used as a shortcut in many situations, for instance when you want to take only the first half of a vector, like this:</p> <pre><code>v(1:end/2); </code></pre> <p>You can split a vector into two by using <code>deal</code> in an anonymous function handle:</p> <pre><code>split_vec = @(x) deal(x(1:floor(end/2)), x(floor(end/2)+1:end)); [a, b] = split_vec(1:10) a = 1 2 3 4 5 b = 6 7 8 9 10 </code></pre>
