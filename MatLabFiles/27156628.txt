Duplicating each cell of a vector in Matlab
<p>I am new to matlab and got some intro questions.</p> <p>If i have a vector A = (1,0,1)</p> <p>I would like to duplicate each cell 5 times to get</p> <p>B = (1,1,1,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,1,1,1)</p> <p>Which ways are there to do it?</p>
<p>One way to do this is to replicate the vector in an additional dimension and then reshape back to the original dimension.</p> <pre><code>B = reshape(repmat(A,5,1),1,[]) </code></pre>
