Matlab,DSP: How to check if an array has hermitian symmetry
<p>I have a rather large piece of code at the end of which I need to apply ifft to an array <code>ZF</code>. <code>ZF</code> is the fft of the columns of a matrix <code>Z</code>. </p> <p>The problem is, the ifft turns out to be a complex double array (which it shouldn't if I did everything correctly) so I need a debugging tool to check at which point of the numerous manipulations I performed on the original DFT I lost the Hermitian Symmetry.</p> <p>The array is a double <code>1024x1376</code></p> <p>my attempt at this is: </p> <pre><code>for i=2:N/2 Herm=ZF(i,:)+ZF(N-i+2,:); end </code></pre> <p><code>N=1024</code> is the number of rows and if Herm is purely real then I have the Symmetry.</p> <p>Any thoughts? I'm still on the first month of MATLAB so if I'm way off feel free to tell me.</p>
