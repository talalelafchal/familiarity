mapping keys and values from a cell array of strings
<p>My Data comes back from a database query into matlab as the following: </p> <pre><code>{10000 by 1 cell} [10000 by 1 double] [10000 by 1 double] [10000 by 1 double] [10000 by 1 double] </code></pre> <p>The first element is a bunch of sharecodes - (not unique, some repeat) </p> <p>The next four elements are, for example:</p> <pre><code>bids, offers, traded price, close price </code></pre> <p>I use <code>share_codes = data{1}</code> which could give me the sharecodes (but they're still a cell)</p> <p>I want to map the share codes to a number which will allow me to work on them in matrix format. </p> <p>I can use </p> <pre><code>keySet = {sharecode1, sharecode2, sharecode3} </code></pre> <p>I can use </p> <pre><code>valueSet = [1,2,3] </code></pre> <p>I can use </p> <pre><code>newMap = containers.Map(keySet, valueSet) </code></pre> <p>However I now want to create a new matrix from the <code>cellarray</code> i.e. which looks into <code>data{1}</code> and now instead of having the <code>sharecodes</code> it now has the mapped numbers. </p> <p>So a cell array which was </p> <pre><code>sharecode1, sharecode2, sharecode3, sharecode2 </code></pre> <p>is now a matrix with</p> <pre><code>1, 2, 3, 2 </code></pre> <p>I would say the real issue is the first element of the cell array is a bunch of strings.</p>
<p>the cellfun function works and is able to return the strings from data{1} (which was a cellarray) as a coloumn vector in the form of type 'double'</p> <p>strings_in_numbers = cellfun(@(x),mapObj(x), share_codes)</p> <p>(found after help from a friend). </p>
