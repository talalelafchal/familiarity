matlab url authentication for imread
<p>How can I use the IMREAD function with a URL that requires basic authentication in MATLAB 2014a? (not the old matlab). It works well for matlab R2013a as described in this link <a href="http://www.mathworks.com/matlabcentral/answers/100103-can-i-perform-basic-authentication-with-urlread-in-matlab" rel="nofollow">http://www.mathworks.com/matlabcentral/answers/100103-can-i-perform-basic-authentication-with-urlread-in-matlab</a> but the above method doesn't work for matlab R2014a because it has different coding in its function files. help needed. thanks in advance.</p>
