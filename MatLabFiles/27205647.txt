MATLAB: fsolve function
<p>I am trying to practice with 'fsolve' and have not figured out fully what's been going on with the following code. Can anyone please shed some light on it?</p> <pre><code>function N=productivity1(N,Ac,Aw) global Thetac Thetaw tau a b N=[N(1),N(2)]; N=[N(1)-(Thetac/a)^(1/b)*(1+tau)*Ac; N(2)-(Thetaw/a)^(1/b)*(1+tau)*Aw; N(1)+N(2)-1]; %this meant to be a constraint... end N0=[0.7,0.3]; %initial guess for x option=optimset('Display','iter'); result=fsolve(@(N)productivity1(N,Ac0,Aw0),N0,option); </code></pre> <p>Here are the details:</p> <pre><code>Ac=2 Aw=20 </code></pre> <p>Ac and Aw should take values such that N(1)+N(2)=1, the starting values of Ac and Aw are not fixed</p> <p>Fixed parameter values</p> <pre><code>Thetac=0.6 Thetaw=0.6 tau=0.07 a=0.01 b=0.8 </code></pre> <p>The output is the same as the vector of initial values regardless of value of the above parameters. This is the issue I am facing. </p>
<p>You need to add diagnostics in your function productivity1 based on the return value exitflag that describes the exit condition of fsolve (<a href="http://nl.mathworks.com/help/optim/ug/fsolve.html" rel="nofollow">http://nl.mathworks.com/help/optim/ug/fsolve.html</a>). </p>
