Store data from for loop in matrix - keep getting error
<p>Sorry, I know this question has been asked a lot and I have looked at those answers but I still can't solve my problem and I'm getting the following error:</p> <pre><code>Subscript indices must either be real positive integers or logicals. </code></pre> <p>Here is my code:</p> <pre><code>for i = 0:10, x1 = rand(1); x2 = rand(1); x = [x1 x2]; Y(i,:) = [x(1) x(2)] end </code></pre>
<p>Matlab indexing starts at 1, not 0 as in some other languages. So in the first iteration of your loop, you have <code>i=0</code>, but you can't do <code>y(0,:)</code>. With the code you have posted, just do <code>for i=1:11</code> to get 11 iterations. (Alternatively, you could just do <code>rand(11,2)</code> if the only goal of the code is to generate the matrix.)</p>
