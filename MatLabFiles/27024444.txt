Loading files in a for loop in matlab
<p>I am trying to load different file names contained in a matlab vector inside a for loop. I wrote the following: </p> <pre><code>fileNames = ['fileName1.mat', ..., 'fileName_n.mat']; for i=1:n load(fileNames(i)) ... end </code></pre> <p>However, it doesn't work because <code>fileNames(i)</code> returns the first letter of the filename only. </p> <p>How can I give the full file name as argument to load (the size of the string of the filename can vary)</p>
<p>Use a cell instead of an array.</p> <pre><code>fileNames = {'fileName1.mat', ..., 'fileName_n.mat'}; </code></pre> <p>Your code is in principle a string cat, giving you just one string (since strings are arrays of characters).</p> <pre><code>for i=1:n load(fileNames{i}) ... end </code></pre> <p>Use <code>{</code> and <code>}</code> instead of parentheses.</p>
