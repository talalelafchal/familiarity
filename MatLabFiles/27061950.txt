How to do Image Processing in Android?
<p>I am new to Android and before I have a knowledge of Image Processing. I used MATLAB for IP but when now I have switched to Android I came to know that Android doesn't support MATLAB Functions or API. <strong>So how can I carry out Image Processing in Android ?</strong> Thanks in Advance.</p>
