Identification of only a part of an image
<p>I want to identify only this marked part in my image. (marked in red) It should be a scale and translation invariant matching algorithm. Which is the best method I can use?</p> <p>Will the SIFT method be useful here? As I have observed, it outputs many points. I want only this predefined part to be identified always. Maybe as a blob, or the centroid of this part.</p> <p><img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/TqxdC.png" alt="enter image description here"></p> <p><em>Edit</em>: I am trying to use SIFT from <a href="http://www.vlfeat.org/overview/sift.html#tut.sift.match" rel="nofollow noreferrer">VLFeat</a>. This is the code I am using:</p> <pre><code>Ia = imread ('Img_1.bmp') ; % Img_1 is the entire wheel's image Ib = imread ('Img_2.png') ; % Img_2 is a small image containing only the part I want to identify in all images. Ia = im2single(rgb2gray(Ia)) ; Ib = im2single(rgb2gray(Ib)) ; [fa, da] = vl_sift(Ia) ; [fb, db] = vl_sift(Ib) ; [matches, scores] = vl_ubcmatch(da, db) ; </code></pre> <p>After this, how can I view the matched images? As it is shown on the website?</p> <p>Also, will this method serve my purpose of identifying only the small notch?</p> <p>How should I proceed after this?</p>
