how to generate bit sequence randomized over 2 bits
<p>I have a network with 4 different types of nodes <strong>A, B, C and D</strong> represented by <strong>00, 01, 10 and 11</strong><br> respectively. I want to create a random sequence of nodes, e.g. <strong>A B D C A D C B C D (00 01 11 10 00 11 10 01 10 11)</strong>, such that: <strong>no_of_type A nodes > no_of_type B nodes > no_of_type C nodes</strong>. How can i generate such a bit sequence using MATLAB.</p>
<p>Use <code>randperm</code> to obtain the random permuation of an ordered sequence of As, Bs, Cs and Ds where the number of As, Bs, Cs, Ds is descending. You can achieve this by drawing random numbers which have a constant sum (effectively drawing one less) and sorting them. In a simple approach you need to retry this several times because the numbers of As, Bs, Cs or Ds cannot be equal according to your specification.</p> <p>Code example:</p> <pre><code>% total length of sequence N = 10; % try again until we found a list of lengths that has no equal entries ni = [0,0]; % as long as there are two equal numbers inside while any(diff(ni) == 0) % one length can be any value n1 = round(rand()*N); % only remaining n2 = round(rand()*(N-n1)); % only remaining n3 = round(rand()*(N-n1-n2)); % remaining n4 = N - n1 - n2 - n3; % sort ni = sort([n1, n2, n3, n4]); end % translate to A, B, C, D r = [repmat('A', 1, ni(4)), repmat('B', 1, ni(3)), repmat('C', 1, ni(2)), repmat('D', 1, ni(1))]; r % random permuatation s = r(randperm(length(r))); s </code></pre> <p>gives:</p> <pre><code>AAAAAAABBC AABAABACAA </code></pre> <p>where the first one is the ordered random sequence (showing that indeed the number of As is larger than the number of Bs, ...) and the second is the desired random sequence. Translating to bits is trivial.</p>
