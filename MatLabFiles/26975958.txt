Matlab - Using 3rd party java classes in Parallel Computing Toolbox
<p>I am using Matlab 2013b and Mosek as an external library to solve demanding integer optimization programs. The problem appears when I try to use the external library together with the Parallel Computing Toolbox. It looks like I do not add the classpath correctly... This is the error:</p> <blockquote> <p>Error using partCorrelationClusteringWithMosek (line 61) An UndefinedFunction error was thrown on the workers for 'Model'. This might be because the file containing 'Model' is not accessible on the workers. Use addAttachedFiles(pool, files) to specify the required files to be attached. See the documentation for 'parallel.Pool/addAttachedFiles' for more details.</p> </blockquote> <p>In general I add the classpath as : </p> <pre><code>javaaddpath('/home/user/mosek/7/tools/platform/linux64x86/bin/mosekmatlab.jar'); </code></pre> <p>but how do I do this in the case of the Parallel Computing Toolbox?</p>
