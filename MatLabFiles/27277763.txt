Drawing multiple polygons in Matlab with no borders
<p>I'm creating a figure with many polygons which can overlap in Matlab. I do not want borders on any of the shapes, only a translucent fill. I was able to get the first shape to obey this request using:</p> <pre><code>fill(xv,yv,'blue','FaceAlpha',0.1,'EdgeColor','None','LineStyle','none');hold on; </code></pre> <p>However, each subsequent shape which is drawn in the loop ignores this style, instead cycling through colored borders. I was able to use the set command to override the color cycle, but this still draws a border...I do <em>not</em> want any border. The border cannot be drawn at all because we are using the overlapping properties of the shapes, and the presence of any borders would perturb the nature of our simulation.</p> <p>Here is the complete code:</p> <pre><code>for count = 1:92 x=randn*clustering; y=randn*clustering; angle=randn*360; rectangle(width,height,x,y,angle); end function rectangle(w,h,x,y,angle) %Define the rectangle xv=[x x+w x+w x x]; yv=[y y y+h y+h y]; %Define the rotation transformation matrix transform=[cos(angle) -sin(angle);sin(angle) cos(angle)]; %Define the translation to origin transform xcenter=x+.5*w; ycenter=y+.5*h; %Perform translation to origin tx=xv-xcenter; ty=yv-ycenter; %Perform rotation rotated=transform*[tx;ty]; %Perform translation back to original location xv=rotated(1,:)+xcenter; yv=rotated(2,:)+ycenter; %Plot result figure(1); plot(xv,yv); fill(xv,yv,'blue','FaceAlpha',0.1);hold on; axis square; axis([-30 30 -30 30]); </code></pre>
