Check if unit vector lies in between two other unit vectors using MATLAB
<p>I've got a two unit vectors (one almost perpendicular to the other). How can I check using matlab if any other unit vector I have lies between these two unit vectors?</p> <p>I have tried sing the dot product, but that gives a false positive when the third unit vector is within the same angle but on the other side of it.</p> <p>Thanks</p>
<p>Lets say you have two unit vectors <strong>a</strong> and <strong>b</strong>, just like your <strong>xyz</strong> axes ( which is a specific case where the vectors <strong>x=a</strong> and <strong>y=b</strong> are perpendicular and nothing happens in <strong>z</strong>) specify quadrants:</p> <p><strong>+a+b</strong>, <strong>-a+b</strong>, <strong>-a-b</strong>, <strong>+a-b</strong>.</p> <p>Now I assume that by "lies between these two unit vectors" you mean quadrant +a+b?</p> <p>If so: you can check this by calculating the projection of your test vector lets say c on vectors <strong>a</strong> and <strong>b</strong>:</p> <p>projection_ConB = <strong>c</strong> * <strong>b</strong>' and similarly <strong>c</strong> * <strong>a'</strong>. Which are indeed the dot products.</p> <p>Now the signs of both these projections will tell you in what quadrant defined by a and b vector c is in.</p> <p>Now I'm not sure if there is a build-in function for this but it should be easy enough to make your own function!</p>
<p>The dot product should work just fine. If <code>a</code> and <code>b</code> define the region and <code>c</code> is the vector to test, then</p> <pre><code>if dot(a,b) &lt; dot(a,c) &amp;&amp; dot(a,b) &lt; dot(b,c) </code></pre> <p>If your vectors aren't actually unit vectors, you'll need to include the lengths in the test.</p> <pre><code>if norm(c) * dot(a,b) &lt; norm(b) * dot(a,c) &amp;&amp; norm(c) * dot(a,b) &lt; norm(a) * dot(b,c) </code></pre>
