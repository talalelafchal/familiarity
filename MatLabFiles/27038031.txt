STRINGIFY in .cpp file
<p>I am reading some .cpp files made to compile them and have a mex file to use in MATLAB for a Level-2 S-Function.</p> <p>I would like to know what is this instruction IN PRACTICE for: </p> <pre><code>#define STRINGIFY(x) #x #define TOSTRING(x) STRINGIFY(x) </code></pre> <p>Thanks for your help.</p>
<p>For example, it can be useful in macros like <a href="http://www.cplusplus.com/reference/cassert/assert/" rel="nofollow">asserts</a>. In case the assert fails, you may not only want to know <em>that</em> something failed, but also <em>what</em> failed. Then you can create a string about the condition that actually didn't hold. Then you can use it to print an error message to the console or use it as description in an exception object.</p> <p>EDIT: In case you were wondering more about why there are <em>two</em> macros doing the same thing, one just referring to the other, you can find the answer in the the <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/6742501/whats-the-exact-step-of-macro-expanding">question referred to by Piotr S. in the comments</a>.</p>
