<p>The error message seems to be clear. Why don't you just display the symbolic object <code>xnew</code> without <code>fprint</code>:</p> <pre><code>disp(fprintf('iter=%6.5f, te=%6.5f, tc=%6.5f, qe=%6.5f, qc=%6.5f, P=%6.5f', iter)); disp(xnew) </code></pre> <p>On the other hand based on your code I assume <code>xnew</code> should be a numeric vector instead of a symbolic variable. This is because your <code>J</code> variable is symbolic. I do not know what you want to accomplish because no description or even a question was given.. but you can try to substitute (<a href="http://www.mathworks.com/help/symbolic/subs.html" rel="nofollow"><code>subs</code></a>) into <code>J</code> to get a numeric vector. It is not a good idea to use the same variable name in symbolic expressions and for numeric data, e.g. <code>tc</code>, <code>tn</code>...</p> <p>You should not hate fluids.</p>
