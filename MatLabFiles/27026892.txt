Find 10 most repeated elements in a vector in MATLAB
<p>I'm suppose to find <code>10</code> most repeated elements in a vector with <code>n</code> elements, </p> <p>(the elements are from <code>1-100</code>)</p> <p>does anyone know how to do that?</p> <p>I know how to find the one that is most repeated element in a vector but I don't know how to find 10 most repeated elements with <code>n</code> being unknown.</p>
<pre><code>a = randi(10,1,100); y = hist(a,1:max(a)); [~,ind] = sort(y,'descend'); out = ind(1:10); </code></pre> <p>for number of occurrences use <code>y(ind(1:10))</code>.</p> <p>I had some doubts so I tested it many times, it seems to work.</p>
<p>Since you already know how to find the most repeated element, you could use the following algorithm:</p> <ol> <li>Find the most repeated element of the vector</li> <li>Remove the most repeated element from the vector</li> <li>Repeat the process on the new vector to find the 2nd most repeated element</li> <li>Continue until you have the 10 most repeated elements</li> </ol> <p>The code would look something like:</p> <pre><code>count = 0; values = []; while count &lt; 10 r = Mode(Vector); values = [values r]; % store most repeated values Vector = Vector(find(Vector~=r)); count = count + 1; end </code></pre> <p>Not efficient, but it'll get the job done</p>
<p>You can use <code>unique</code> for that case. In my example, I have 4 numbers and I want to grep the 2 with the most occurances.</p> <pre><code>A = [1 1 3 3 1 1 2 2 1 1 1 2 3 3 3 4 4 4 4]; B = sort(A); % Required for the usage of unique below [~,i1] = unique(B,'first'); [val,i2] = unique(B,'last'); [~,pos] = sort(i2-i1,'descend'); val(pos(1:2)) 1 3 </code></pre> <p>Replace <code>val(pos(1:2))</code> by <code>val(pos(1:10))</code> in your case to get the 10 most values. The get the number of elements you can use <code>i1</code> and <code>i2</code>.</p> <pre><code>num = i2-i1+1; num(1:2) ans = 7 3 </code></pre>
