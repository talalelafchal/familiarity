Calculating the corelation of 2D signals with different sizes
<p>I am trying to calculate the correlation between two different signals and it works perfect if the signals have the same size. But it gives an error if there size is different. So I am wondering if there is any way that I can change the size of one to the other so they can have the same size? Any Help??</p> <p>As example: </p> <p>If signal 1 is a matrix of size <code>130X9</code> and signal <code>2</code> is another matrix of size <code>122X12</code> and they look the same .. so what I need is to scale one of them to the other, so both of them can be of size <code>130X9</code> or <code>122X12</code>.</p> <p>My code:</p> <pre><code>norm_xcorr_mag = @(x,y)(max(abs(xcorr(x,y)))/(norm(x,2)*norm(y,2))); norm_xcorr_mag(signal1,signal2); </code></pre>
<p>If you have <code>signal processing toolbox</code>,</p> <pre><code>A = randi(100,[130 9]); B = randi(100,[122 12]); MaxRow = max(size(A,1),size(B,1)); MaxCol = max(size(A,2),size(B,2)); NewA = resample(A,MaxRow,size(A,1)); NewB = resample(B,MaxRow,size(B,1)); NewA = resample(NewA',MaxCol,size(A,2))'; NewB = resample(NewB',MaxCol,size(B,2))'; </code></pre> <p><code>NewA</code> and <code>NewB</code> are both <code>130x12</code></p> <p>You could also try <code>intrep1</code>.</p>
