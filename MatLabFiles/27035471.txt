matrix inside matrix when multiplying symbolic matrices
<p>In matlab, i'm trying to multiply symbolic matrices(size 3X3). The output shows matrix having some elements which are themselves matrices. why some of the elements are matrices?</p> <p>Example code:</p> <pre><code>syms a1 a2 a3 F2 = [a1+0.0003 .0002 .0004; a2+.0003 .0005 .0003; a3+.0003 .0002 .0004]; C2 = F2'*F2; K = C2^(16/57); T = inv(K)*C2*inv(K); S = T - 0.5*T^2 + 0.33*T^3; </code></pre>
<p>The problem seems to be the <code>K = C2^(16/57)</code>. Taking the root of a matrix is not trivial and solutions don't always exist. That's why MATLAB cannot resolve this expression. Try for example:</p> <pre><code>A = syms('A',[3,3]); % create 3x3 symbolic matrix B = A^(1/3); % calculate the 3rd root of A </code></pre> <p>The result will be</p> <pre><code>ans = matrix([[a1_1, a1_2, a1_3], [a2_1, a2_2, a2_3], [a3_1, a3_2, a3_3]])^(1/3) </code></pre> <p>The same happens in your case. If you look closely, you will see that the <code>matrix</code> expression in <code>S(1,1)</code> is of the form <code>matrix(...)^(32/57)</code></p>
