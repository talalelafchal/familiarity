quickly find the indexes of common rows in two matrices
<p>Thanks in advance for the help.</p> <p>Suppose that I have two matrices: A and B. I want to know which rows in A are also in B. For example given </p> <pre><code>A = [1 2; 3 4] and B = [1 2; 5 6; 7 8] </code></pre> <p>I would like an output of </p> <pre><code>out = [1 0]; </code></pre> <p>A simple way of doing this is to use for loops but my A and B matrices are both very large. Using for loops is thus exceedingly slow (it would likely take several hours to handle just two matrices and I have several thousand to compare). Is there a way that I could do this using Matlab's built-in functions (which are optimized to handle matrix operations)?</p>
<p>There is a way to do it with MATLAB's built-in functions!</p> <pre><code>out = ismember(A, B, 'rows'); </code></pre>
