Show progress of a Matlab instruction execution
<p>Is there any way to show the execution progress (even a rough estimation) of a Matlab instruction?</p> <p>For example let's say I am computing distances using pdist:</p> <pre><code>D = pdist(my_matrix,'cosine'); </code></pre> <p>and this computation takes hours, does Matlab provide any way to show periodically the execution progress?</p>
<p>Not intrinsically. You can of course do after-the-fact checking with the profiler or tic/toc.</p> <p>If this is something you will be doing a lot for a single function, you could consider modifying the function and saving it in your path with a new name (I have a directory called "Modified Builtin" for just this purpose). In the case of <code>pdist.m</code>, you might save <code>pdist_updates.m</code>. Looking a the function, the actual distances are calculated starting around line 250 with a series of nested loops. Add in a line like:</p> <pre><code>disp(sprintf('Processing pair %d of %d',i,n-1)); </code></pre> <p>at line 265. If you really wanted to get fancy, you could use <code>tic</code> and <code>toc</code> to time each loop and provide an estimate of how long the entire calculation would take so you would know how long you had to run to the coffee machine.</p> <p>Of course this will cause problems if you end up cancelling your Statistics Toolbox license or if Mathworks upgrades the toolbox and changes the functionality, so use this approach sparingly.</p>
