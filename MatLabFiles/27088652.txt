Inversion and point subtraction on Elliptic Curve
<p>I'm trying to implement an authentication protocol based on elliptic curve over prime field in Matlab. I have already done the point addition and point multiplication successfully, but I'm facing a problem while computing the following steps: (Capital letters are points on the curve, small letters are integer scalars)</p> <pre><code>((y^-1)T4-T2)(rs^-1) = x1P ((y^-1)T5-x1T3)(rs^-1) = X2 </code></pre> <p>Should I compute</p> <p><code>y^-1</code></p> <p>as</p> <pre><code>ModInverse(y , prime)? % the multiplicative inverse of y mod prime </code></pre> <p>Also, is that how I'm supposed to do the subtraction?</p> <pre><code>nT2 = T2; nT2{2} = mod(-nT2{2}, prime); </code></pre> <p>(Negate the y-coordinate of a point) mod prime, and then do the addition on <code>nT2</code> and another point</p>
<p>I can help you in finding negative co-ordinate of y. I am explaining with a toy example:</p> <p>sum = [673 146] % Now to convert 2nd element of sum which is the y coordinate, do the following.</p> <p>sum(1,2) = -sum(1,2) % this will negate the 2nd element of 1st row of sum and store the result into sum. % now to perform subtraction, do the following. Assume that your addend is N1 = [ 6,5] and augend is the sum, therefore, the difference of these two is...</p> <p>difference = addell(N1,sum,a,b,p) % where a,b and p are parameters of the ECC. %Thaat is a and b are constants and p is the prime modulus of the ECC. For example of an ECC is y^2=x^3+a*x +b mod p</p> <p>Hope this will suffice your 2nd question.</p>
