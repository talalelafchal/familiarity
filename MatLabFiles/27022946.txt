Create a Contour Plot from Two Matrices
<p>I am having difficulty producing a contour plot from two matrices;</p> <p>I have one matrix <code>A</code> 9×8 with values (an amount of something), and another matrix 9×8 <code>B</code> where each entry corresponds to a location of an entry in <code>A</code>.</p> <p>The issue is that the entries do not fall on a rectangular grid.</p> <p>I'm trying to create a contour plot of the Y-Axis values (from matrix <code>A</code>), based on the X-axis values from matrix <code>B</code>.</p> <p>I've tried <code>meshgrid</code> (based on the x and y ranges for <code>B</code>), however the values in matrix <code>B</code> are not evenly spaced;</p> <p>Any help would be greatly appreciated!</p>
