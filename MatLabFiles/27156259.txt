Maximum of the difference of values of a vector
<p>I have a vector:</p> <pre><code>A = 0.5743 -0.3167 0.0591 -0.2576 0.0000 0.2576 -0.0591 0.3167 -0.5743 </code></pre> <p>I want to store the differences between each value of the array A in an array or in a matrix, and find the maximum difference value, and output the indices (that is, v(1) - v(3) yields the maximum, for example) that yields the maximum. Does anyone have any suggestions?</p>
<p>Is this what you want?</p> <pre><code>d = abs(bsxfun(@minus, A, A.')); %'// compute all differences [~, ind] = max(d(:)); %// find linear index of maximum difference [row, col] = ind2sub([numel(A) numel(A)], ind); %// convert to row and column </code></pre> <p>The sought indices are given by variables <code>row</code>, <code>col</code>. The difference matrix is <code>d</code>.</p> <p>Alternatively, the first line could be replaced by</p> <pre><code>d = squareform(pdist(A)); </code></pre>
<p>I don't think you need to compute all the differences. You just need to find the maximum and minimum and subtract.</p> <pre><code>[max_val, max_ind] = max(A(:)); [min_val, min_ind] = min(A(:)); disp(['Max difference is ', num2str(max_val - min_val), ' which is the difference between indicies ', num2str(max_ind), ' and ', num2str(min_ind)]); </code></pre>
