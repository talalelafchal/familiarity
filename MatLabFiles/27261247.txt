how to calculate a summation in matlab
<p>I have an equation to get the summation of ∑ X + 4 ∑ X <em>26</em> Y + ∑ Y I just started using matlab and I want to use it to calculate the result </p> <p>what I have is an array with values of X, array with the values of Y both arrays have the same length </p> <p>-I found a function but didn't get how to use it numeric::sum(f(x), x in {x1, x2, …}) -I can't use the value of i (summation counter) not the values i need </p> <p>can I calculate the result without using for loops? or is there a way to calculate the terms in X and in Y each one separately with loops and the ones with both terms in with for a loop</p>
<p>Be careful when searching for matlab functions online, if you see things with double colons (like <code>numeric::sum</code>), they're likely to be MuPAD functions. You can run MuPAD within matlab, but you don't need to. In matlab, just use sum(x) and you'll get an answer.<br> When you're just starting to learn matlab, a great command is <a href="http://www.mathworks.com/help/matlab/ref/lookfor.html" rel="nofollow"><code>lookfor</code></a>. In the command line, just type in things like <code>lookfor sum</code> and it will return a list of functions that you can explore.</p>
