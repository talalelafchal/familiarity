How use the function 'legendshrink' in Matlab2014b
<p>Today, I find a bug in Matlab2014b. I use 'legendshrink' for plotting the figures, but it shows "Index exceeds matrix dimensions.", why ? The following code:</p> <pre><code> plot(1:10,'.-'); plot(10:-1:1,'o-'); legend({'one' 'two'},'location','north') legendshrink </code></pre> <p>The function 'legendshrink' is from <a href="http://github.com/wspr/matlabpkg/" rel="nofollow">http://github.com/wspr/matlabpkg/</a> . </p>
<p>MATLAB 2014b introduced a new graphics framework. It looks like your <code>legendshrink</code> program is not compatible with the new framework, but works with the old one in 2012a. Perhaps you should contact the author and ask them to make some changes to support the new framework.</p> <p>That's likely to be quite a big change: in the old framework, a legend was actually just an extra axis added to the plot. In the new framework, there's a completely new sort of object to represent legends.</p> <p>Your error is coming from line 104, where the code looks for children of a legend axis of type <code>'Line'</code>. In the new framework, legend objects don't have any children of type <code>'Line'</code>, so <code>legendshrink</code> as it's currently implemented is not going to work at all.</p> <p>To be clear, this is not a bug in MATLAB 2014b, it's that <code>legendshrink</code> is not compatible with MATLAB 2014b.</p>
