How to customize files obtained from RTW
<p>I use Matlab R2008a and I try to replace handmade C code with code generate from Simulink model. I've reach a good result but in some file I've an unnecessary function , generated to initialize the data structure : _initialize(). Now, how can avoid the generation of this function? More in general, is possible configure RTW so to generate only one *.c and only one *.h files (except rtwtypes.h)</p> <p>Thanks for your suggestion</p> <p>Below my configuartion :</p> <p>MATLAB Version 7.6<br> Simulink Version 7.1<br> Real-Time Workshop Version 7.1<br> Real-Time Workshop Embedded Coder Version 5.1 </p>
