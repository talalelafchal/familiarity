Compiling MatConvNet on Windows
<p>I am trying to compile <a href="http://www.vlfeat.org/matconvnet/" rel="nofollow">MatConvNet</a> on Windows 8.1. Since it seems that I need to use the "Makefile" to do that, I downloaded <a href="http://gnuwin32.sourceforge.net/packages/make.htm" rel="nofollow">GNUWin Make</a>, which allows to use the <em>make</em> command on Windows. The error I get is the following one:</p> <pre><code>process_begin: CreateProcess(NULL, C:\Program Files\MATLAB\R2014a\bin\mexext, ...) failed. </code></pre> <p>while the file <code>C:\Program Files\MATLAB\R2014a\bin\mexext.bat</code> exists.</p> <p>Do you have any clue on that please?</p>
<p>I also tried to compile MatConvNet on Windows with MinGW and I faced the same error. Instead, you can try to compile MatConvNet using Visual Studio. It is explained here: <a href="http://blog.csdn.net/zxd675816777/article/details/40075209" rel="nofollow">http://blog.csdn.net/zxd675816777/article/details/40075209</a></p> <p>With the translation from Chrome browser, it is understandable :) Thanks to this tutorial, I successfully generated the 4 mexw64 files needed by MatConvNet.</p>
<p>in the new beta-8 we have added new function <code>vl_compilenn</code> which supports compilation on Windows... (no need for Make, plus we've fixed the issues related to msvc compiler). So far it seems to work also for the GPU code...</p> <p>You can find detail <a href="http://www.vlfeat.org/matconvnet/install/" rel="nofollow">here</a>. Hope that this would help :)</p>
