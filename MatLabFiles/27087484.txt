Plot a figure in which there is an image that moves and rotates
<p>I am going to plot a dynamic image (moving, rotating) within a MATLAB figure. How can I do that?</p> <p>I know that for embedding an image in MATLAB i should use this code:</p> <blockquote> <p>I = imread('image.jpg');</p> <p>figure;</p> <p>hold on;</p> <p>image([-1 1],[1 -1],I);</p> </blockquote> <p>How to draw the image by indicating its center position and its scale. How to move / rotate it?</p> <p>Also, is there a way to plot the object with its background transparent?</p>
<p>Here is an example to start with,</p> <p>This is the simplified code in <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/26717775/animate-text-in-matlab">here</a>.</p> <pre><code>load topo n = size(topomap1,1); topo = (topo - min(topo(:))) ./ range(topo(:)); I = ind2rgb(round(topo*(n-1)+1), topomap1); [X,Y,Z] = sphere(n); for i = 1 : n [az,el,r] = cart2sph(X,Y,Z); az = az + 2 / n * pi; [X,Y,Z] = sph2cart(az,el,r); warp(X,Y,Z,I) axis equal off pause(.1) end </code></pre> <p><img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/SNRDS.gif" alt="enter image description here"></p> <p>You can change <code>I</code> to any image, like <code>I = imread('peppers.png');</code></p> <p>Also you can change the surface to any (see <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/27056373/save-animated-warp-as-a-gif-file-in-matlab">here</a>).</p>
