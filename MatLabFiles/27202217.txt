Plotting an equation with two input variables using meshgrid() in MATLAB - matrix incompatibility
<p>I am trying to plot a 3D graph of an equation that has two input variables: time, t and spring constant, K in order to investigate the effect of K on the output. I have looked in to how to plot a function with two input variables using meshgrid() and converting the two inputs into compatible matrices.</p> <p>For multiplying one of those inputs, say 't'. The multiplication sign needs to be preceded by '.' e.g <code>y = t.*C</code> (where C is some constant). For two inputs it is the same; <code>e.g y = t.*C + K.^2</code>.</p> <p>However I cannot find how to do that for division, if the variable is in the numerator I assume you can simply write the expression as say: <code>t*1/C</code>. However how do you write it when the variable is in the denominator as in <code>'C/t'</code>. I have tried placing '.' after 't' in the denominator however I get an error: </p> <blockquote> <p>Error using /<br> Matrix dimensions must agree.</p> </blockquote> <p>Also do I need to put the '.' after the variable in an addition?</p> <p>Apologies if all this seems vague. I can put in the actual equation however it extremely long and it works when only t is a variable and K is a constant so the equation itself is sound.</p>
<p>The operations that have to be preceded with a <code>.</code> to apply element-wise are:</p> <ul> <li>Multiplication: <code>.*</code></li> <li>Division: <code>./</code></li> <li>Power: <code>.^</code></li> </ul> <p>Thus, if <code>A</code>, <code>B</code>, and <code>C</code> are arrays, you write</p> <pre><code>y = (A.*B./C).^2 </code></pre>
