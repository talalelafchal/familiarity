Solving overdetermined system of nonlinear conditional equations with MATLAB's lsqnonlin function
<p>My functional model consists of a nonlinear conditional equation of the form </p> <pre><code>a^x + b^x - 1 = 0 </code></pre> <p><code>a</code> and <code>b</code> are known. Therefore, I can solve this easily using Gauss-Newton iterations or MATLAB's in-built <code>fsolve</code> function. But: What if I have multiple versions of <code>(a,b)</code> tuples fitting the same model defined by <code>x</code>?</p> <p>I'd like to solve the resulting overdetermined system by MATLAB's <code>lsqnonlin</code> function, but it of course aims only at minimizing the sum of residuals, whereas I want to minimize the sum of residuals AND the conditional equations be fullfilled. What's the proper proceeding here?</p>
