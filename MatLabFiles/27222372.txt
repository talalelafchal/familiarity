Matlab function block Slows down Simulink simulation drastically
<p>I am trying to add a matlab function block to a simulink model available in all matlab installations (commcdma2000). Adding a matlab function block slows down the simulation very drastically. I am using the standard malab function block instead of the interpreted MATLAB Function block because it is supposed to be faster. Also all that I do in the matlab function block is to assign the input to the output so there is no complex computation. I would like to add more complex logic within this block as part of my project and hence I pose this question.</p>
