python loading several matlab files
<p>I was wondering of how I can load several matlab files in python. I am very new to python and don't know much</p> <p>I am using <code>scipy.io.loadmat('/~/20130228_100000_3D_E=1.mat')</code> and then I save the data in .vts format</p> <p>How can I do this with all the available matlab files I have by running my program only once?</p> <p>Thanks </p>
<p>If all the <code>.mat</code> files are in the same directory, you could do this:</p> <pre><code>import os dataDir = "/some/folder/containing/data/" mats = [] for file in os.listdir( dataDir ) : mats.append( scipy.io.loadmat( dataDir+file ) ) </code></pre> <p>You would then have all the matlab files in a list (like arrays in other languages), you can get at them by:</p> <pre><code>mats[0] mats[1] ... </code></pre>
