Marking fingerprint minutiae - Matlab
<p>I have a project on Fingerprint Matching and I got stuck on marking <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minutiae" rel="nofollow">minutiae</a>.<br> I have already binarized the image, closed and thinned it and now I have to use Crossing Number to find termination and bifurcation points. How do I mark them on the image and also store them? Thanks!</p>
<p>You should look into <a href="http://www.mathworks.com/help/images/ref/bwmorph.html#inputarg_operation" rel="nofollow"><code>bwmorph</code></a> - a function that allows you to perform all sorts of morphological operations on images. </p> <pre><code>ep = bwmorph( BW, 'endpoints' ); %// returns a mask with the "terminations" bp = bwmorph( BW, 'branchpoints' ); %// returns a mask with "bifurcations" </code></pre> <p>To get the coordinates of the special points from the masks, you can simply use <code>find</code>:</p> <pre><code>[epy epx] = find( ep ); %// x,y coordinates of all endpoints. </code></pre>
<p>I normally use frequency transforms to get the minutiae. Maybe try this algorithm : ieeexplore.ieee.org/iel5/4263198/4263199/04263211.pdf?arnumber=4263211 or there's code in matlab you can look at: <a href="https://www.mathworks.com/.../44369-fingerprint-matching--a-simple-approach" rel="nofollow">https://www.mathworks.com/.../44369-fingerprint-matching--a-simple-approach</a></p>
