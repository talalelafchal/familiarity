How to find all linear columns dependency in matrix
<p>I want to find the index of all linear columns in matrix. The output is a vector in which gives 1 for independent columns and -1 for all linear dependency columns. For example, I have a matrix A that is</p> <pre><code>A = 1 0 0 0 0 1 1 1 0 0 1 0 1 1 1 1 1 0 1 1 1 1 1 1 0 1 1 0 </code></pre> <p>We can see that column dependency are 1,2,3,5,6. Hence my expected result are</p> <pre><code>output=[-1 -1 -1 1 -1 -1 1]; </code></pre> <p>And the independent matrix remains</p> <p>A =</p> <pre><code> 0 1 1 1 0 1 0 0 </code></pre> <p>How to implement it by matlab ? How about with linear rows?</p>
<p>I think you are looking for something like this -</p> <pre><code>out = ones(1,size(A,2)) out(sum(all(bsxfun(@eq,A,permute(A,[1 3 2])),1),2)&gt;=2)=-1 </code></pre> <p>So, basically for each column, it finds if there are any other matching columns and if there are, it identifies that as a "dependent" (from what I could gather as the definition for this problem) column.</p> <p>Output -</p> <pre><code>out = -1 -1 -1 1 -1 -1 1 </code></pre> <hr> <p>For finding "dependency" across rows, use this -</p> <pre><code>out = ones(1,size(A,1)) out(sum(all(bsxfun(@eq,A,permute(A,[3 2 1])),2),1)&gt;=2)=-1 </code></pre>
