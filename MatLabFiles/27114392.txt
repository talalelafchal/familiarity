Cell Array to Array in Matlab
<p>I have a cell array with 5 cells as shown beblow </p> <pre><code>&lt;18250x1 int32&gt; &lt;18250x1 int32&gt; &lt;18250x1 int32&gt; &lt;18250x1 double&gt; &lt;18250x1 double&gt; </code></pre> <p>In each cell, there are numbers of 18250 rows and 1 column.</p> <p>Now I want to calculate the average of each row in cells 4 and 5, resulting another cell of &lt;18250x1 double>.</p> <p>I think the best way is to convert the cell array to array. But the function cell2mat only allows the array to have the same data types. I need to maintain the data types of int or double in the output. Anybody know how to solve this problem?</p> <p>Thanks, James.</p>
