Parallel scripts on MATLAB
<p>I have two systems running on MATLAB: the control system and the computer vision system.</p> <p>The control system needs to receive three variables generated by the computer vision system periodically. However, I can't single thread both systems, because the computer vision system latency is too high compared with the control system latency.</p> <p>I tried to run each program in a different MATLAB session and use a .mat file as interface between both sessions, but it did not work.</p> <p>I'm not familiar with the Parallel Computing Toolbox. So I was wondering if someone can help with this? Or at lest give a start up idea, because, as I've said, I will start to learn the Parallel Computing Toolbox now. </p>
<p>In addition to parfeval as suggested by @Dima you might also want to look into <a href="http://www.mathworks.com/help/distcomp/labsendreceive.html" rel="nofollow">labSendReceive</a> and associated function like labSend and labReceive which allow to share data between individual workers in your parallel pool. I guess which one is best for you depends on the type of calculation you want to do.</p>
<p>I think the function in the Parallel Computing Toolbox you may be looking for is <a href="http://www.mathworks.com/help/distcomp/parfeval.html" rel="nofollow">parfeval</a>. It lets you spawn an asynchronous task, and get its result whenever it is ready.</p>
