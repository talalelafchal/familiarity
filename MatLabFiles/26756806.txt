How to plot Magnitude response focusing on passband ripple
<p>I have been asked to plot the magnitude response of an impulse using butterworth filter. I did that already, [b,a] = butter(n, Wn, 'low') &amp; freqz(b, a)</p> <p>However, I have also been asked to output the magnitude response focusing on the passband ripple</p> <blockquote> <p>Plot the magnitude response (in dB) from ω = 0 to ω = π using freqz. Plot a detail of the magnitude response, focusing on the passband ripple (linear scale)</p> </blockquote> <p>What are the steps to do this in matlab? is there a command where I can output this without using the fdatool? I do not know what to do. Thanks in advance!</p>
<p>Well, if I understand your question correctly, I think it is pretty easy..
