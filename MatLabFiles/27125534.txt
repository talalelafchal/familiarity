Concentrate dataset arrays in matlab
<p>Hi I have many arrays of different lengths now I want to create ONE long array (1D) out of all of them. Counterintuitively vertcat gives me a dimension error even though I do not see the point why the dimensions of my arrays should match.</p> <p>Am I using vertcat wrong? </p>
<p>Your vectors are probably column vectors of different lengths (or matrices). Suppose <code>A</code> to <code>D</code> are the matrices you want to create a 1D-vector from. Try "flattening" them out using <code>(:)</code>, and vertcat thereafter, like this:</p> <pre><code>long_1D_vector = [A(:); B(:); C(:); D(:)]; </code></pre> <p>You may transpose it if you want a column vector instead:</p> <pre><code>long_1D_vector = [A(:); B(:); C(:); D(:)].'; </code></pre>
