Matlab - Identifying objects in one image that overlap objects in another
<p>I have two images, one of some cells and another of the nuclei of those cells. I've segmented these images to give two binary images/matrices. I would like to remove cell outlines that contain no nuclei, and cells and nuclei that correspond to clusters of cells (i.e. cell outlines that contain more than one nuclei).</p> <p>I really can't figure this out... I can use bwlabel to make labelled arrays of the objects:</p> <pre><code>[cell, cellnum] = bwlabel(cells,8); [nuc, nucnum] = bwlabel(nuclei,8); </code></pre> <p>How can I compare these two arrays to get one new array that only contains cells with exactly one nucleus and another with the nuclei corresponding to these cells?</p>
<p>One thing you could do is loop through the clusters you identified in your <code>cells</code> binary image (conceptual, untested code):</p> <pre><code>for k=1:cellnum [~, nucnum(k)]=bwlabel(nuclei.*(cell==k)); end </code></pre> <p><code>nucnum</code> is then a vector with the number of nuclei found inside every cell. Filter according to your needs.</p> <p>I recommend this blog post on the subject of segmenting cells and nuclei: <a href="http://blogs.mathworks.com/steve/2006/06/02/cell-segmentation/" rel="nofollow">http://blogs.mathworks.com/steve/2006/06/02/cell-segmentation/</a></p>
