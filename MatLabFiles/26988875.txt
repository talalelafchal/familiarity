How to change image pixels values?
<p>I have an image and I want to assign different value for each pixel location (x,y) as follow:</p> <p>v(x,y) = a(y^2) + b(y) + c</p> <p>where a, b, and c are parameters determined empirically. </p> <p>How can I do that in matlab? I mean how can I change pixels values of an image there?</p>
<p>It appears you only want to change the image values based on the y coordinate, so create a new matrix <code>y</code> like this:</p> <pre><code>y = (1:height)' * ones(1,width); </code></pre> <p>where height and width are the size of your image:</p> <pre><code>[height, width] = size(v); </code></pre> <p>then create your image <code>v</code>:</p> <pre><code>v = a.*(y.^2) + b.*y + c; </code></pre> <p>This will work if <code>a</code>, <code>b</code>, and <code>c</code> are single values or matrices with the same size as <code>y</code>.</p> <p>Hopefully that is what you were asking for.</p>
<p>Speaking of image and pixel is misleading in your case (it seems you are just speaking about matrix). Try to run this code:</p> <pre><code>a = 1; b = 2; c = 3; x = 1:100; % x and y define from 1 to the value for the size of your matrix y = 1:100; [X, Y] = meshgrid(x,y); </code></pre> <p>You can then get the value V with the following code:</p> <pre><code>V = a * Y.^2 + b * Y + c; </code></pre> <p>And plot it with:</p> <pre><code>figure; imagesc(V); </code></pre> <p>Cheers</p>
