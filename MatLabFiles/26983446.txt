Matlab index with specific values using loop
<p>I know how to write the program with a given number of entries, but not when if the number of entries are n:. Basically I think I need a loop but I can't get it to work properly.</p> <hr> <p>This is a code that works fine when having 3 entries. % is what I put in. I want to create a vector with specific position and values, this is a example how the vector would look like:</p> <pre><code>X = [1;0;0;0;0;0;0;0;0;0;0;0;0;0;99;0;0;0;0;99] </code></pre> <p>and the code for it:</p> <pre><code>n1 = input('Determine value for case:'); %n1 = 1 n2 = input('Determine value for case:'); %n2 = 15 n3 = input('Determine value for case:'); %n3 = 20 X = zeros(20,1); X(n1) = input('Determine position '); %1 X(n2) = input('Determine position '); %99 X(n3) = input('Determine position '); %99 </code></pre> <hr> <p>But for n entries, I need a loop I figured. (the vector may still be 20x1)</p> <pre><code> for n = 1:entries (%entries are 3, so 3 loops) n = n+1 n = input('Determine value for case :'); X =zeros(20,1); X(n) = input('Determine position:') end </code></pre> <p>But I can't just get it to work</p> <p>thanks in advance</p>
<p>Not sure exactly what you are trying to achieve, but I think that you can fix your loop as follows:</p> <pre><code> entries = 3; X =zeros(20,1); for ni = 1:entries n = input('Determine value for case :'); X(n) = input('Determine position:'); end </code></pre>
