Calling static method from m-file (octave/matlab)
<p>I am currently having problems calling a static method located in an m-file, through the octave command interface. The error I'm getting is <code>error: invalid call to script path/to/Test.m</code></p> <p>Test.m:</p> <pre><code>classdef Test methods(Static=true) function ret = test_function() ret = 0; end end end </code></pre> <p>I am trying to call the method in the following way: <code>> Test.test_function()</code>. It's important to note that the script resides in the same directory in which I invoked the <code>octave</code> command, the script Test.m shows up using tab completion so the location is not at fault here I guess.</p> <p>Any help is much appreciated, thanks in advance!</p>
<p>From the <a href="http://wiki.octave.org/FAQ" rel="nofollow">Octave FAQ</a>: "Matlab <code>classdef</code> object oriented programming is not yet supported, though work is underway in a branch of the development tree." So the error is likely arising from the lack of <code>classdef</code> support, and the parser can't make sense of the call at all.</p>
