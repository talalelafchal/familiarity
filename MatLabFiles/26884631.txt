automatically get the name vectors saved in the workspace in Matlab
<p>I have multiple vectors (+100) that have been loaded into MATLAB workspace, I would like to write a script that can plot and save them all, but for that I need their name, my question is: is there a way to automatically get the name vectors saved in the workspace.</p> <p>thanks in advance. </p>
<p>Step one: whoever gave you a *.mat file with 100+ named variables in it, [censored for strong language and scenes some viewers may find upsetting]. I am only partly joking here; if you find yourself in this sort of situation normally it is because something has gone terribly wrong upstream. We can work around it, though.</p> <p>Step two: use <code>who</code> with the filename to get a list of variables in that file</p> <pre><code>names = who('-file', 'all'); </code></pre> <p>Step three: load the variables (or a subset of them) into a struct</p> <pre><code>data = load('all.mat'); </code></pre> <p>Step four: use dynamic structure naming to extract data:</p> <pre><code>for n = 1:length(names); plot(data.(names{n})); % or whatever you want to do with this data end </code></pre> <p>I would probably just use the loop to dump the data in a cell array so as to make further processing simpler and avoid further use of dynamic field names or worse, <code>eval</code>.</p>
<p>You can use <a href="http://www.mathworks.com/help/matlab/ref/who.html" rel="nofollow">who</a>, which lists all variables alphabetically in the active workspace.</p>
