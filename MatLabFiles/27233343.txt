How to use Matlab embedded coder under Windows to compile for LINUX?
<p>I'm trying to compile a Simulink algorithm to a CarPC. The CarPC is based on a Intel Atom processor and runs in LINUX. The idea is compile the Simulink code with the Matlab embedded coder to the specific target.</p> <p>The problem is I don't know if I can use my Windows version of Matlab to compile the algorithm and then use it on LINUX. I mean, compile from Windows to LINUX.</p> <p>Is it possible with my Matlab R2014a from Windows to the Intel Atom processor with LINUX?</p>
<p>As @ThP said, yes you can. One option is to generate the C code on the Windows machine and then move the generated code to a machine that has a C compiler for the embedded target and compile the C code there.</p> <p>Make sure that you set up the <a href="http://www.mathworks.com/help/simulink/gui/hardware-implementation-pane.html" rel="nofollow">target hardware</a> in:</p> <pre> Simulation > Model Configuration Parameters > Hardware Implementation </pre> <p>to be compatible with your Atom processor/compiler. Also set up the model to <a href="http://www.mathworks.com/help/dsp/ug/generate-code-from-simulink.html#bsz7ylp" rel="nofollow">generate code only</a> in:</p> <pre> Simulation > Model Configuration Parameters > Code Generation </pre> <p>if you are planning on compiling the generated code on another machine.</p> <p>There is a good deal of additional information about generating code for other targets in <a href="http://www.mathworks.com/help/rtw/target.html" rel="nofollow">the Simulink Coder documentation</a>.</p>
