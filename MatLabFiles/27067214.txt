Input must be a string MATLAB ERROR when using cellstr(sentiment)
<p>My sentiment variable is cell class put when I try parse it to the cellstr fucntion it throws the following error...</p> <blockquote> <blockquote> <p>cellstr(sentiment) Error using cellstr (line 32) Input must be a string.</p> </blockquote> </blockquote> <p>I am trying to use the unique command but it throws this error... Error using cell/unique (line 85) Input A must be a cell array of strings.</p> <p>When I open the variable there is a single column with sentiments positive, negative, neutral but it looks like each cell has a sub-cell. Could this be a reason for the errors? If so how would I correct this ?</p> <p>I take a cell array that contains some unnecessary characters so i filter out for the relevant word using:</p> <pre><code>for i= 1:length(sentdate) s=sentiment{i}; sentiment{i}={s(15:22)}; s2=date{i}; date{i}={s2(17:26)}; </code></pre> <p>Thanks in advance</p>
<p>You don't need the curly brackets around whatever you're assigning into a cell. The assignment is exactly symmetric to reading out the value:</p> <pre><code>s = sentiment{i}; sentiment{i} = s(15:22); </code></pre> <p>Surrounding a value with <code>{}</code> actually creates a cell array, which is why you appear to have a subcell. To help understand this difference between <code>()</code> and <code>{}</code>, try this:</p> <pre><code>sentiment(i) = {s(15:22)}; </code></pre> <p>Same result! By using <code>()</code> to index sentiment, we're not dereferencing the cell contents. So then the value to be assigned must itself be a cell.</p>
