Applying matlab histogram values to matrix in matlab
<p>This might be simple and I apologize if it is so.</p> <p>In matlab I have a double precision matrix which can theoretically have the range of +/- infinity.</p> <p>I would to use the histogram function in matlab to change the values of the matrix.</p> <p>For instance, if data elements fall within histogram bin 1 then I would like to assign the value of 1 to this and all of its instances.</p> <p>Is there a quick and cheap way of doing this?</p> <p>I have tried lookuptables etc but matlabs LUT is a pain.</p> <p>Thank you for looking at my question</p>
<p>I think I just cracked it ...</p> <p>Make a new function out of hist and after edges in the m file add this line:</p> <pre><code>[~,my_labels] = histc(y,edges,1); </code></pre> <p>and my_labels will contain your matrix with the histogram values instead of the actual values. </p>
