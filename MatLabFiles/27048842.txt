Matlab (How to fit multiple data sets )
<p>Suppose I have for vectors x1, y1, x2, y2, and I would like to plot this data (x1,y1) and (x2,y2) with different colors. The dimesions of vector x1,y1 are not the same with x2,y2. Than I would like also to fit all this data together, with the same polynomial fit, degree 1.</p> <p>Can someone help me to do it?</p>
<p>You can plot the vectors simply using <code>plot</code>:</p> <pre><code>plot(x1, y1, 'r.', x2, y2, 'b.') </code></pre> <p>where the <code>'r.'</code> specifies that this first pair should be plotted in red dots, and the <code>'b.'</code> specifies that the second pair should be plotted in blue dots. You can find a more complete list of color/marker options in the help documentation for <code>plot</code>.</p> <p>To fit a polynomial to (x,y) data, you can use <code>polyfit</code>:</p> <pre><code>poly_coeffs = polyfit( x, y, poly_degree ) </code></pre> <p>If you want to fit the same polynomial to both sets of data, you should concatenate your vectors into a single vector, e.g. (in the case of row vectors):</p> <pre><code>x = [x1, x2] y = [y1, y2] poly_coeffs = polyfit( x, y, poly_degree ) </code></pre> <p>If you have column vectors, you would use <code>x = [x1; x2]</code> (note the semicolon instead of the comma) to concatenate them vertically.</p> <p>And now if you wanted to plot the polynomial fit on top of the original data, you can add it on to the list of arguments to <code>plot</code>:</p> <pre><code>curve_x = linspace( min(x), max(x), 100 ); curve_y = polyval( poly_coeffs, curve_x ); plot(x1,y1,'r.', x2,y2,'b.', curve_x,curve_y,'k-'); </code></pre>
