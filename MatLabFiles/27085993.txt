Variant Manager Missing from Simulink
<p>After watching some videos on how to use variant subsystems in a design, I was able to get variants working.</p> <p>But <a href="http://www.mathworks.com/videos/managing-design-variants-68948.html" rel="nofollow">this video</a> tutorial (Managing Design Variants) from Mathworks mentions a Variant Manager which I have been unable to find in my version of Simulink. I am running version R2011b.</p> <p>My View menu is different form the one in the tutorial, but it shows tabs for the Library browser, the Model Explorer and the Simulink Project. But I don't see any sign of a Variant Manager. I checked the other menu tabs with the same results.</p> <p>Documentation help doesn't find anything on Variant Manager either.</p> <p>Is the Variant Manager something introduced in a later version? Which one did it start in?</p> <p>Or is there something I can configure to in order to use it?</p>
<p>The Variant Manager was introduced in R2013b, see the <a href="http://uk.mathworks.com/help/simulink/release-notes.html" rel="nofollow">release notes</a> (under R2013b, Component-Based Modeling).</p>
