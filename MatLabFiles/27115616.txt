Why cube is not getting generated properly
<p>I have a cube which makes some angle with X axis.</p> <p>For that I have written my cube vertices like this: </p> <pre><code>cubeX=[ 0 cosd(theta) (cosd(theta)+sind(theta)) sind(theta) %bottom 0 cosd(theta) (cosd(theta)+sind(theta)) sind(theta) %top 0 cosd(theta) cosd(theta) 0 %front 0 cosd(theta) cosd(theta) 0 %back sind(theta) 0 0 sind(theta) % left (cosd(theta)+sind(theta)) cosd(theta) cosd(theta) (cosd(theta)+sind(theta)) % right ]*side; cubeY=[ 0 -sind(theta) (cosd(theta)-sind(theta)) cosd(theta) %bottom 0 -sind(theta) (cosd(theta)-sind(theta)) cosd(theta) %top 0 -sind(theta) -sind(theta) 0 %front 0 -sind(theta) -sind(theta) 0 %back cosd(theta) 0 0 cosd(theta) %left (cosd(theta)-sind(theta)) -sind(theta) -sind(theta) (cosd(theta)-sind(theta)) %right ]*side; cubeZ=[ 0 0 0 0 %bottom 1 1 1 1 %top 0 0 1 1 0 0 1 1 0 0 1 1 0 0 1 1 ]*side; </code></pre> <p>But when I plot this using <code>plot3(cubeX,cubeY,cubeZ)</code> one line i.e. bottom right line is not drawn</p> <p>Can someone please explain what I maybe doing wrong</p> <p><img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/52Klt.png" alt="cube generated by matlab"></p> <p>Also attached is the image which shows the angle with X axis <img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/IaUHA.png" alt="enter image description here"></p>
<p>You need to close each one of your faces...meaning that each square that you're drawing needs 5 points instead of 4. The last point (the 5th point) should be the same as the first point. For example:</p> <pre><code>cubeX=[ 0 cosd(theta) (cosd(theta)+sind(theta)) sind(theta) 0 %bottom 0 cosd(theta) (cosd(theta)+sind(theta)) sind(theta) 0 %top 0 cosd(theta) cosd(theta) 0 0 %front 0 cosd(theta) cosd(theta) 0 0 %back sind(theta) 0 0 sind(theta) sind(theta) % left (cosd(theta)+sind(theta)) cosd(theta) cosd(theta) (cosd(theta)+sind(theta)) (cosd(theta)+sind(theta)) % right ]*side; </code></pre> <p>Without the extra point, your squares will have four points but only 3 lines. Adding the extra point will give your squares four lines, which will close them off. This should result in drawing your missing line.</p> <p>Also, your cubeX, cubeY, and cubeZ might be the wrong shape for what you intend. I would expect them to have 4 (now 5) rows and 6 columns. You might try transposing them...</p> <pre><code>plot3(cubeX',cubeY',cubeZ') </code></pre>
