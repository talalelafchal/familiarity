Create Circle In 3-D Axes
<p>I am newbie in <code>matlab</code>.</p> <p>I want to draw something like below pic in 3-D axes and move it mouse move.</p> <p>i do not have problem with second part(move objects on mouse move) , i do not know how to create this circle in 3-D axes</p> <p><img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/k7u4Q.png" alt="enter image description here"></p>
<pre><code>elevation = linspace(0,2*pi,100); r = ones(1,100); azimuth = .75 * pi *ones(1,100); while 1 axis([-10 10 -10 10 -10 10]) view([20 20 5]) [newx newy] = ginput(1); [x,y,z] = sph2cart(azimuth,elevation,r); x = x + newx; y = y + newy; patch(x,y,z,[1 0 0],'EdgeColor','r'); axis([-10 10 -10 10 -10 10]) end </code></pre> <p>You can change the radius by <code>r</code> like <code>r = .5 * ones(1,100);</code></p> <p><img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/4krp6.png" alt="enter image description here"></p> <p>But the coordinates of click doesn't seem to be right.</p> <p>I think you have solved that problem in your previous question.</p> <p><strong>Note</strong></p> <blockquote> <p>Coordinates returned by <em>ginput</em> are scaled to the XLim and YLim bounds of the axes you click (data units). The figure <em>CurrentPoint</em> property, by contrast, is always returned in figure Units, irrespective of axes Units or limits`</p> </blockquote>
