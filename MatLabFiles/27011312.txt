Face detection MATLAB - slanted and up side down
<p>I am working on a MATLAB project which enables the user to do face detection and blur them out. </p> <p>Built-in functions used:</p> <pre><code>vision.CascadeObjectDetector </code></pre> <p>The problem with this function: It only detects frontal faces.</p> <p>The methods I tried: Use imrotate function in a while loop to rotate the image while the degree is less then 360. So I thought that it would work. I increment the rotation by 23 everytime.</p> <p>Cons: It doesn't work, it changes the spatial resolution of the image.</p>
<p>I have done some experiments in the past, and I have learned that the <code>vision.CascadeObjectDetector</code> using the default frontal face model can tolerate about 15 degrees of in-plane rotation. So I would advise rotating the image by 15 or even 10 degrees at a time, rather than 23.</p> <p>The problem with training your own detector in this case is the fact that the underlying features (Haar, LBP, and HOG) are not invariant to in-plane rotation. You would have to train multiple detectors, one for each orientation, every 15 degrees or so.</p> <p>Also, are you detecting faces in still images or in video? If you are looking at a video, then you may want to try tracking the faces. This way, even if you miss a face because somebody's head is tilted, you'll have a chance to detect it later. And once you detect a face, you can track it even if it tilts.
