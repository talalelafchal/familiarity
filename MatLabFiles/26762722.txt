MATLAB Java Errors, Can't Save Data
<p>I'm running an xPC target system for a low speed wind tunnel. At the end of a three hour test, MATLAB threw an exception that it couldn't save the data. I'm now getting class def errors like this for everything I try to click or do in the GUI (this is just one example). The command 'ver' is the only thing that seems to work. This means I can't save my data, which I really need. I would normally just restart MATLAB, but that will lose all my data!</p> <pre><code>Exception in thread "AWT-EventQueue-0" java.lang.NoClassDefFoundError: com/mathworks/widgets/grouptable/EditOnClickHandler$4 at com.mathworks.widgets.grouptable.EditOnClickHandler.setEnabled(EditOnClickHandler.java:130) at com.mathworks.mlwidgets.explorer.widgets.table.FileTable$4$1.run(FileTable.java:188) at java.awt.event.InvocationEvent.dispatch(Unknown Source) at java.awt.EventQueue.dispatchEvent(Unknown Source) at java.awt.EventDispatchThread.pumpOneEventForFilters(Unknown Source) at java.awt.EventDispatchThread.pumpEventsForFilter(Unknown Source) at java.awt.EventDispatchThread.pumpEventsForHierarchy(Unknown Source) at java.awt.EventDispatchThread.pumpEvents(Unknown Source) at java.awt.EventDispatchThread.pumpEvents(Unknown Source) at java.awt.EventDispatchThread.run(Unknown Source) </code></pre> <p>Please help, I need this data as quickly as possible! Thanks! </p>
