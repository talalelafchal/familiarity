Why the fourier spectra concentrated to the border of the image (in Matlab)?
<p>I am confusing about a question related to fourier transform. In matlab, I created an image:</p> <p>F = [ zeros(56, 128); ones(16, 128); zeros(56, 128)];</p> <p>which was an image as follow: <img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/SxJLy.jpg" alt="enter image description here"></p> <p>Then I transformed it with:</p> <p>Fhat = fft2(F);</p> <p>and tried to show the fourier spectra:</p> <p>imshow(log(1+abs(Fhat)),[]);</p> <p>The image was like follow:<img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/MTcd4.jpg" alt="enter image description here"></p> <p>I wondering why the fourier spectra I got was concentrated to the border of the image?</p> <p>Is there any mathematical interpretation?</p> <p>I am new in this area, so please explain for me in detail if possible!</p> <p>Thanks!</p>
<p>Unlike you might expect matlab places the low frequency components on the edge of the image.</p> <p>In terms of frequency the fft values will go [+low f -> +high f -> -high f -> -low f]. I don't know why matlab does it like this.</p> <p>As @Kamtal commented you can use <a href="http://www.mathworks.co.uk/help/matlab/ref/fftshift.html" rel="nofollow">fftshift</a> to rearrange the fft matrix so that the zero frequency component is at the center.</p> <p>Given this knowledge the transform you achieved is as expected. There is no change in the x direction in your input image so only the lowest x frequency components have non-zero values, and these are at the edge of the image.</p>
