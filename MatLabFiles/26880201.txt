How to get a voronoi diagram's edges and their associate sites in MATLAB?
<p>I created a voronoi diagram. Now what I want to do is to store every edge and its two associated sites. For example, I got the diagram as the following: <img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/mdE9w.jpg" alt="enter image description here"></p> <p>Say I want to store the edge <code>(v4, v5)</code> and its associate sides, <code>X3</code> and <code>X8</code>. </p> <p>I used</p> <pre><code>[VX,VY] = voronoi(X(:,1),X(:,2)); </code></pre> <p>to create this voronoi diagram. Thus I could use <code>VX</code> and <code>VY</code> to get all the edges. However, I do not really know how to get the edge's associate sides. In other words, I can get the edge <code>(v4, v5)</code>, but I have no idea to achieve its associate sites,<code>X3</code> and <code>X8</code>, and make edge <code>(v4, v5)</code> pointed to <code>X3</code> and <code>X8</code>.</p> <p>Could someone give me some ideas please?</p> <p>Thanks very much!</p>
<p>You can use C array of Voronoi cells from (see here <a href="http://www.mathworks.nl/help/matlab/ref/voronoin.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.mathworks.nl/help/matlab/ref/voronoin.html</a>)</p> <pre><code>[V,C] = voronoin(X) </code></pre> <p>You can also use (see exmple here <a href="http://www.mathworks.nl/help/matlab/math/voronoi-diagrams.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.mathworks.nl/help/matlab/math/voronoi-diagrams.html</a>)</p> <pre><code>dt = delaunayTriangulation(X); [V,R] = voronoiDiagram(dt) </code></pre>
