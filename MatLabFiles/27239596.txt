How to read trc files from different directory in matlab
<p>I have a program that reads data from <code>.trc</code> files. But as of now, it can only read the <code>.trc</code> files that are in the current directory i.e the MATLAB folder. If I want it to read a file, I have to copy the file in MATLAB folder. Is there a way I can move to different directories and choose another <code>.trc</code> file? I have tried using <code>dir</code>, <code>uigetdir</code> etc. but nothing seems to work!</p>
<p>It's pretty straightforward to filter results with the <code>dir</code> command with a file extension if you specify the folder to search with a wildcard character in place of the file name. You can then loop over the generated list of file names in the output structure (as shown) or whatever you need to do with those files.</p> <pre><code>folderName = 'C:\Path\To\Target\Folder\'; fileList = dir(strcat(folderName, '*.trc')); for k = 1:length(fileList) fileHere = fullfile(folderName, fileList(k).name); % Do what you need with the files in here end </code></pre>
