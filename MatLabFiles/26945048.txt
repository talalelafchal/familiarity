MATLAB 2014b Parallel Figures
<p>I am using MATLAB R2014b on Mac OS X 10.10 Yosemite. Since I will be plotting a large amount of figures, I am seeking for a parallel computing solution. The test code I am using is as follows:</p> <pre><code> parfor ii=1:12 figure(ii);plot(ii*2:ii:ii*10000); set(ii,'PaperPositionMode','auto','Color',[1 1 1]); set(ii,'Units','pixels','Position',[0 0 1200 800]); saveas(ii,[num2str(ii),'test.png']); end </code></pre> <p>MATLAB was able to generate the figures with the correct filename. However, the saved image is strangely cropped. An example of the images can be found here: <a href="https://i.stack.imgur.com/xwA0R.png" rel="nofollow noreferrer"><img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/xwA0R.png" alt="enter image description here"></a></p> <p>I tried removing the two lines which set the image size and paper position, however the problem still exists.</p> <p>I would like to know what I have done wrong, or it is simply a bug with MATLAB R2014b.</p> <p>Regards, Jonathan</p> <p>Update:</p> <p>Just found out that such a problem does not exist with contour plots.</p>
