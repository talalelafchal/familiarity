Attempting a MATLAB program for interest calculation
<p>I am attempting to write a super basic program for a homework assignment and I am having difficulty getting started and was hoping for a little help. Here is the prompt: Imagine that you went to the bank and deposited $20,000 in an account that earns 6% interest every year, with each yearâ€™s interest being deposited back into the account. Write a MATLAB program that computes the number of years it would take to accumulate $500,000. </p> <p>So, I know I need to declare a few variables and I want to use a for loop with an if statement because we have not covered while loops yet. Here is my attempt so far:</p> <pre><code>%This program calculates interest accumulated on a given value and the %years it would take to reach a given goal value %initial deposit Deposit = 20000; year = 0; for year = 1:1:n year = year + 1; Deposit = Deposit*(1.06); if Deposit &lt; 500000 end </code></pre> <p>Thanks all!!</p>
<p>There are two approaches to the for loop here. One is what you originally had:</p> <pre><code>year = 0; for i = 1:n year = year + 1; % blah blah Deposit end </code></pre> <p>In this case, the <code>i</code> is counting the number of for loop iterations, and you're incrementing the <code>year</code> variable inside the loop. As @Peter pointed out, this is redundant, you can simply use <code>year</code> as the loop variable, and then it is automatically incremented by nature of being the loop variable.</p> <pre><code>for year = 1:n % No need to increment "year", that is being done by the for loop % blah blah Deposit end </code></pre> <p>I liked your original idea better (it'll generalize better to when you learn about <code>while</code> loops). Whatever version you choose, though, it will end up running exactly <code>n</code> iterations, which is probably not what you want. In order to stop it early, you need the <code>break</code> command:</p> <pre><code>for ... % blah blah Deposit if (something about the Deposit) % We achieved our stop condition, so break out of the for loop break; end % Go on to the next for loop iteration end </code></pre> <p>When it hits the <code>break</code> statement, MATLAB skips straight to the end of the loop.</p> <p>However, this does raise one concern: you won't know if you exited the loop because you hit <code>n</code> iterations or because you encountered the <code>break</code> statement. So you should add some kind of check before you assume that this is the value for <code>year</code> that you are looking for.</p>
