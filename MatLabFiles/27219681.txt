Matlab :how to get indices of the filtered output
<p>I am designing a filter for a wavfile , actually what i want to do is to separate a band of certain frequencies , amplify them and then add them back to the wav file </p> <pre><code>[y Fs]=wavread('test_2.wav'); Wp = [1100 2200]/Fs; Ws = [1000 2500]/Fs; Rp = 3; Rs = 40; [n,Wn] = buttord(Wp,Ws,Rp,Rs) [b,a] = butter(n,Wn); z=filter(b,a,y); gain = 20; filtered = gain .* z; </code></pre> <p>what i have managed to do to separate the certain band through a band pass filter and amplify it with a scaler now i want to add it back to the wav file , is there any built-in command through which i can get the exact indices of the filtered output (find() doesn't work )</p>
<p>You can use <code>filtfilt</code>.</p> <blockquote> <p>y = filtfilt(b,a,x) performs zero-phase digital filtering by processing the input data, x, in both the forward and reverse directions.</p> </blockquote> <p>So in your case,</p> <pre><code>z = filtfilt(b,a,y); gain = 20; filtered = gain .* z; y = y + filtered; </code></pre>
