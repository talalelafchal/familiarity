how to find out the exact threshold value for the correct recognition of person
<p>hello I am novice here in matlab my task is to write a code for multimodal biometric system using discrete wavelet transform and pca (principle component analysis) for 100 people database containing 9 face, 2 ear and 2 thumbprint images. for same I wrote following code for each sample </p> <pre><code>E11=imread('E1(1).JPG'); E11=imresize(E11,[100 100]); E11=rgb2gray(E11); %colormap(pink) [a,b,c,d]=dwt2(E11,'haar'); X=a;E11=X(:); E11=im2double(E11); for reading all those images </code></pre> <p>after that i applied pca on all these images and after it i used the minimum distance classifier mindist=dist(i);</p> <pre><code>for i=2:10 if dist(i)&lt; mindist mindist=dist(i); end end for i=1:10 if dist(i)== mindist img=i; break; end end disp(['Recognized image number as class................']); disp(img); if dist(img)&gt;=600; img=i; end </code></pre> <p>like this of course before this i had found weight vectors and all after this i had wrote switch case for identifying the person</p> <pre><code>figure subplot(1,2,1) imshow(y), title('Image to be Recognized'),colormap(gray); subplot(1,2,2) x1=imresize(x1,[100,100]); imshow(x1), title('Recognized Image'),colormap(gray); toc and the above last code is for recognising that image </code></pre> <p>now my question is al this code works well for 5 classes showing correct output for 70%(no.of correct images/total no. of images) but i have to extend this code for 100 people it shows very less accuracy how can i do this please guide me i will be very grateful to you for same</p>
