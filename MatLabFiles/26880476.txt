plot triangle in MATLAB
<p>I want to plot a triangle based on an equation in Matlab.</p> <p>I create equation <code>g</code> for my triangle which I need to use for convolution later.</p> <p>The picture below is the simple triangle I want to plot</p> <p><img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/RIox3.png" alt="enter image description here"></p> <p>However my code produces this:</p> <p><img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/hCmWP.png" alt="enter image description here"></p> <p>My question is, how to make the other side slope? and after the top of my triangle will not return to <code>1</code>. In case I want to make it triangle</p> <p>Here is my code:</p> <pre><code>%%Declaration dt = 0.001 ; %Equation for h(t) as rect function T = -1: dt: 3; g = 0.*(T&gt;= -1 &amp; T&lt; -0) + (-2*T).*(T&gt;= 0 &amp; T&lt;=1) + 0.*(T&gt; 1&amp; T&lt;=3) ; %Triangle at Graph(g) is at negative side, so need to turn at positive side h= abs(g); %Plot Graph(G) in declaration of Graph(h) in absoulute value plot(T,h);ylim([0 2.5]);ylabel('Triangular,h');xlabel('Time (Second)'); title('Figure 2(a)') </code></pre>
<p>Looking at your equation for <code>h</code>, you have three sections. You also have three sections in your chart. The first and last section are <code>0</code> and the second section is an increasing line.</p> <pre><code>h = 0.*(T&gt;= -1 &amp; T&lt; 0) + (2*T).*(T&gt;= 0 &amp; T&lt;=1) + 0.*(T&gt; 1&amp; T&lt;=3); </code></pre> <p>So section 1 is between -1 and 0 and equals 0 i.e. <code>0.*(T&gt;= -1 &amp; T&lt; 0)</code>, section two is between 0 and 1 and is a positive increasing line with gradient 2 crossing the y-axis at 0 i.e. has the y=mx+c equation of y=2x and in your case y is <code>h</code> and x is <code>T</code> thus <code>(2*T).*(T&gt;= 0 &amp; T&lt;=1)</code>.</p> <p>So now all you need is the downward sloping equivalent. It slopes down from (1,2) to (2,0) which give the equation y = -2x + 4 so finally we get</p> <pre><code>h = 0.*(T&gt;= -1 &amp; T&lt; 0) + (2*T).*(T&gt;= 0 &amp; T&lt;=1) + (-2*T + 4).*(T&gt; 1 &amp; T&lt;=2) + 0.*(T&gt; 2 &amp; T&lt;=3); </code></pre>
