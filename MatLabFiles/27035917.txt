MATLAB GUI - Making Checkbox Global
<p>I have a <code>MATLAB GUI</code> which gives options to tick for the user. Every tick has a different mathematical significance. After user ticks something the calculation will be done after they press to 'Calculate'.</p> <p>My main formula under Calculate button is:</p> <pre><code>effective_weight = weight + pilotsw + fo_weight %pilots weight &amp; first officer's weight </code></pre> <p><code>pilots_weight</code> &amp; <code>fo_weight</code> has different checkboxes and they have the following code:</p> <pre><code>function checkbox2_Callback(hObject, eventdata, handles) % hObject handle to checkbox2 (see GCBO) % eventdata reserved - to be defined in a future version of MATLAB % handles structure with handles and user data (see GUIDATA) % Hint: get(hObject,'Value') returns toggle state of checkbox2 % --- Executes on button press in checkbox3. if (get(hObject,'Value') == get(hObject,'Max')) pilotw = -100 else pilotw = 0 end </code></pre> <p>global pilotw (and same for first officers's check box)</p> <p>and pilotw is a global variable for calculate function.</p> <p>Aim is to change the effective weight and do the rest of computations accordingly if the pilot is there (or not).</p>
<p>In order to access the global variable <code>pilotw</code>, you need to declare it as such in your function:</p> <pre><code>function checkbox2_Callback(hObject, eventdata, handles) %'Declare global variable' global pilotw %'Set global variable' if get(hObject,'Value') == get(hObject,'Max') pilotw = -100 else pilotw = 0 end; end </code></pre>
<p>You need declare global pilotw in each function you want to use this variable. </p>
