Obtaining depth image from 2D image
<p>Considering <a href="http://www.imagesocket.com/photos/guest/2725930" rel="nofollow">this example</a>, is there an efficient method for obtaining depth image (b) from 2D image (a)?</p> <p>I know DIBR can be used, but are there any other methods ?</p>
<p>The statement <code>DIBR can be used</code> is wrong. DIBR is a method that works with 3D videos, <strong><em>using</em></strong> the depth image to enhance the 2D view. It is not fully automated, you need to supply the depth map by hand for DIBR to work.</p> <p>You can, however, use 2 cameras to obtain 3D information from 2 x 2D; or use <strong>2D video</strong> to <strong><em>estimate</em></strong> depth from pixel motion. Some other approaches use perspective information of the 2D image to imitate human understanding of depth - like roads, buildings.</p> <p>In conclusion, depth map generation from plain 2D image is a harder problem than that of stereo vision, or infrared projectors used in depth sensors.</p>
