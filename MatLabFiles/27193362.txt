Error with Guide: Attempt to reference field of non-structure array
<p>I am trying to use a gui I did in MATLAB using GUIDE, when I double click on the .fig file and fill the text field and press on the push button, I have the following error message, but if I right click on it and select edit with GUIDE then pressed run figure (the green triangle), when I fill the value and press on the button, it works normally and gives me the results.</p> <p>Error message: </p> <pre><code>Attempt to reference field of non-structure array. Error in FYP&gt;pushbutton1_Callback (line 474) d1min = str2double(get(handles.d1min,'String')); Error in gui_mainfcn (line 96) feval(varargin{:}); Error in FYP (line 16) gui_mainfcn(gui_State, varargin{:}); Error in @(hObject,eventdata)FYP('pushbutton1_Callback',hObject,eventdata,guidata(hObject)) Error while evaluating uicontrol Callback </code></pre>
<p>As an extension of my comment, here is what the doc says about .fig and .m files generated by GUIDE (available <a href="http://www.mathworks.com/help/matlab/creating_guis/files-generated-by-guide.html" rel="nofollow">here)</a>:</p> <blockquote> <p>By default, the first time you save or run a GUI, GUIDE stores the GUI in two files:</p> <p>A FIG-file, with extension .fig, that contains a complete description of the GUI layout and each UI component, such as push buttons, axes, panels, menus, and so on. The FIG-file is a binary file and you cannot modify it except by changing the layout in GUIDE. FIG-files are specializations of MAT-files. See Writing Custom Applications to Read and Write MAT-Files for more information.</p> <p>A code file, with extension .m, that initially contains initialization code and templates for some callbacks that control GUI behavior. You generally add callbacks you write for your UI components to this file. As the callbacks are functions, the GUI code file can never be a MATLABÂ® script.</p> </blockquote> <p>So as you see you need to run the .m file in order to launch the GUI. Hope it's a bit clearer now :)</p>
