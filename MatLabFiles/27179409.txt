MATLAB Solving non-linear algebraic equation
<p>I am trying to solve a vectorial equation where vectors are in polar form</p> <p>the equation is</p> <p>100*exp((pi/3)*j) + 200*exp(x(1)<em>j) - 300</em>(x(2)*j) - 315 = 0;</p> <p>as you can see there is two unknowns in this equation x(1) and x(2) and since it's a complex equation i should be able to get them by equation both the real and imaginary part to 0.</p> <p>i tried to use fsolve but the accuracy is very bad and it doesn't get any better as i increase it</p> <p>my script :</p> <pre><code>function F = myfun(x) F = [real(100*exp((pi/3)*1i) + 200*exp(x(1)*1i) - 300*exp(x(2)*1i) - 315); imag(100*exp((pi/3)*1i) + 200*exp(x(1)*1i) - 300*exp(x(2)*1i) - 315)]; </code></pre> <p>my matlab code :</p> <pre><code>x0 = [0,0]; options = optimset(optimset('fsolve'), 'TolFun', 1.0e-25, 'TolX',1.0e-25); [x,fval] = fsolve(@myfun,x0,options); </code></pre> <p>the given answer for x(2) is 2.1246 however the real answer is 2.1237 and this difference is too big for me.</p> <p>any ideas ?</p> <p>Thanks in advance</p>
<p>Matlab works fine , I had a Typo in my code , the correct equation is</p> <p>100*exp((pi/3)*j) + 200*exp(x(1)j) - 300(x(2)*j) - 315 = 0 with pi/3 not 3/pi</p> <p>Thanks for everyone</p>
