Can't compute homography
<p>I'm quite inexperienced with Matlab and image processing, and I've been struggling with this problem for the past few days.</p> <p>I have a 12 point correspondence between coplanar plane coordinates and their image projections. I also know the intrinsics of the camera. From what I understood, this is enough to compute the homography. (My final goal is to obtain the extrinsic parameters of the camera, which I believe is straightforward after computing the homography H.)</p> <p>I've tried different methods to obtain H, but I get a different matrix with each method/function I try, when apparently they all have the same input/output. For example, using vgg_H_from_x_lin(X1,X2) found here <a href="http://www.robots.ox.ac.uk/~vgg/hzbook/code/" rel="nofollow">http://www.robots.ox.ac.uk/~vgg/hzbook/code/</a> and homography_solve from <a href="http://www.mathworks.com/matlabcentral/answers/26141-homography-matrix" rel="nofollow">http://www.mathworks.com/matlabcentral/answers/26141-homography-matrix</a> gives me 2 completely different matrices.</p> <p>I've tried this as well, <a href="https://cseweb.ucsd.edu/classes/wi07/cse252a/homography_estimation/homography_estimation.pdf" rel="nofollow">https://cseweb.ucsd.edu/classes/wi07/cse252a/homography_estimation/homography_estimation.pdf</a> , which led me to another different H.</p> <p>What am I doing wrong here? This should be quite simple as I have the point correspondence and the camera intrinsics, but I can't understand how to compute H correctly.</p> <p>Thanks in advance.</p>
