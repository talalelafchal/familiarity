Multiple object detection using SURF features in MATLAB?
<p>I have training sets of each of the indivdual objects shown in this following image. This one image is also the query image: <img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/1SGVm.jpg" alt="enter image description here"> Four of these training sets have 18 images each, consisting of images cropped down and taken at different angles. I also have another training set of another object. That object should not be detected with this queried image.</p> <p>Objective: Identify all of the objects in the query image. Could be any uniform background, hoping to go toward any background also (cluttered scene, random background). My research and questions: </p> <ol> <li><p>Should I be using the cascade object detection which uses the Viola-Jone algoritm and discount SURF features? I would give negative examples in this case.</p></li> <li><p>Use KNN (k=2) method? I tried using this and the accuracy isn't that great.</p></li> <li><p>Use SVM? Don't know to much about this but I know that it has something to do with bag of features...</p></li> <li><p>Just use matchFeatures function iterative and set up a ratio of number of features matched over the number of features in a training set.</p></li> </ol> <p>Final question: I need some direction toward my objective. Any links and direction would be greatly appreciated. If you refer me to one of my four notes I made, please explain.</p>
