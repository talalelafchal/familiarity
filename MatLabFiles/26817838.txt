ttest results in Matlab?
<p>I am computing those three matrices</p> <pre><code>A = [1 2 3 4 5 6]'; B = [50987548463 45764568 606978 7318 1674 4]'; C = [50 45 60 78 1 4]'; </code></pre> <p>Why on earth does <code>ttest(A,B)</code> <strong>returns 0</strong> (no rejection of null hypothesis, which means the means are the same with 95% confidence level) while <code>ttest(A,C)</code> <strong>returns 1</strong> (rejection of null hypothesis, which means the means should be different with 95% confidence level)</p> <p>I would expect rejection of null hypothesis for both ttest, but even more for ttest(A,B)!!</p>
<p>Mean and standard deviation of (A-B) set are high, but t-statistics is -1.0011, which is sufficient to reject H0. Mean and std of (A-C) are smaller, but t-statistics is -2.7612, which is not sufficient to reject H0 with only 5 degrees of freedom. You can check it using</p> <pre><code>[h1,p1,ci1,stats1] = ttest(A,B) [h2,p2,ci2,stats2] = ttest(A,C) </code></pre>
