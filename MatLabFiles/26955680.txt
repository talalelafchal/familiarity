Find intersection in noisy Hough transform
<p>I have various sets of points, which are supposed to be part of different lines (see image below). What I want to do is to group the points which are part of the same line. To do so, I made a Hough transform that turns cartesian coordinates into polar one. What I need to do is to locate the position of the intersection in the Hough plane; do you have any suggestion on how to do it?</p> <p>This is what I am doing now:</p> <ol> <li><p>Apply a threshold to the image of the Hough transform, so to consider only the pixels with at least half of the maximum intensity</p> <pre><code>max_Hough = max(max(Hough)); for ii = 1:dim_X for jj = 1:dim_Y if Hough(ii,jj) &gt; max_Hough*0.5 Hough_bin(ii,jj) = Hough(ii,jj); end end end </code></pre></li> <li><p>Locate the blobs in the corresponding image</p> <pre><code>se = strel('disk',1); Hough_final = imclose(Hough_bin,se); [L,num] = bwlabel(Hough_final); % Let's exclude the single points counts = sum(bsxfun(@eq,L(:),1:num)); valid_blobs = find(counts&gt;threshold); number_valid = length(find(counts&gt;threshold)); if (number_valid~=0) for blob_num = (1:number_valid) for x = (1:dim_X) for y = (1:dim_X) if (L(x,y) == valid_blobs(blob_num)) hist_bin_clean(x,y) = Hough_final(x,y); end end end end end </code></pre></li> <li><p>Find the centroids of the blobs </p> <pre><code>Ilabel = bwlabel(hist_bin_clean); stat = regionprops(Ilabel,'centroid'); </code></pre></li> </ol> <p>You can see the result in the second image below, with the centroid pointed by the white arrow. I would expect it to be a few pixels higher and to the left... How would you improve the result?</p> <p><img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/RtZ3S.jpg" alt="The points I need to group"></p> <p><img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/OJjo1.jpg" alt="enter image description here"></p>
