Matlab, looking to place the next value from an array in the legend each time a loop executes
<p>I am trying to get the legend to show a fixed value and one that is from an array. I have managed to get the fixed value to display and when I manually enter the position from the array this will display. I want the position selected from the array to advance by 1 each time. I tried to use the n variable that I have defined in the script but it doesn't seem to work. At the moment I have entered a value of 4 and this selects the 4th value from the array. I am new to matlab and can't for the life of me think how to do this. Any help is appreciated. Here is my script I am working with.</p> <pre><code>clear clc f = @(x,k,lamda) ((lamda.^k).*(x.^(k-1)).*(exp(-lamda.*x))./(factorial(k-1))); colors = ['k', 'r' , 'g', 'b', 'y', 'm', 'c']; hold on n=1; k = 5; x = 0 :0.1: 10; for lamda = 1 : 0.2 : 2; ncol= mod(n,7)+1; plot(x,f(x,k,lamda), 'Color', colors(ncol)) l = 1 : 0.2 : 2; legstr(n,:) = strcat ('k = ', num2str(k), ' Lamda = ', num2str (l(4))); legend(legstr) title('Erlang Distribution') xlabel('X') ylabel('f(x,k,lamda)') n=n+1; end hold off </code></pre>
<p>You were almost there. No need to introduce another vector to pull from since the value you have assigned to <code>lamda</code> in each loop iteration will work. Also you'll have to change <code>legstr</code> from a matrix to a cell array to deal with the fact that <code>lamda</code> sometimes has an extra digit in the decimal place, which will cause the legend string to be longer or shorter, depending.</p> <pre><code>clear all clc f = @(x,k,lamda) ((lamda.^k).*(x.^(k-1)).*(exp(-lamda.*x))./(factorial(k-1))); colors = ['k', 'r' , 'g', 'b', 'y', 'm', 'c']; hold on n=1; k = 5; x = 0 :0.1: 10; for lamda = 1 : 0.2 : 2; ncol= mod(n,7)+1; plot(x,f(x,k,lamda), 'Color', colors(ncol)) % l = 1 : 0.2 : 2; legstr{n} = strcat ('k = ', num2str(k), ' Lamda = ', num2str (lamda)); legend(legstr) title('Erlang Distribution') xlabel('X') ylabel('f(x,k,lamda)') n=n+1; end hold off </code></pre>
