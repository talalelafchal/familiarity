How do I create an array in matlab consisting of multiple 3d imagedata arrays
<p>I have 15 images that I am reading using <code>imagedata = imread('imagename.jpg')</code> its size is always <code>320 by 320 by 3</code></p> <p>How do I put the data in an array (using a for for loop) such that when I access the first element of the new array I get the RGB data of the first image I input?</p>
<p>You should probably use <code>cell</code></p> <pre><code>imCell = {}; for i = 1 :15 imCell{i} = imread(num2str(something)); end </code></pre> <p>And you could easily have access,</p> <pre><code>for j = 1 : 15 subplot(5,3,j); imshow(imCell{j}); end </code></pre> <p><code>imCell</code> is a cell with size <code>1x15</code>. However <code>imCell{i}</code> is an arrey with size <code>320x320x3</code>.</p> <p>Using cell will allow you to even save arrays of different sizes in it.</p>
<p>Since all images have the same size, it may be more efficient to use a 4D array than a cell array:</p> <pre><code>imArray = NaN(320,320,3,15); for n = 1:15 imArray(:,:,:,n) = imread(filename); %// filename should probably change end </code></pre> <p>You can then access the first image as <code>imArray(:,:,:,1)</code>, etc.</p>
