How to get &quot;mse&quot; after &quot;newfit&quot; training from MATLAB command line
<p>I have below code</p> <pre><code>trainData = [11x293 matrix consist of double values]; trainTarget = [3x293 matrix consist of binary values]; testData = [11x32 matrix consist of double values]; trainTarget = [3x32 matrix consist of binary values]; net = newfit(trainData,trainTarget,{20}); net = train(net,trainData,trainTarget); predicted = sim(net,testData); % predicted matrix is consist of double values as prediction of trained network </code></pre> <p>I want to access Mean Squered Error (MSE), which generated after network training, from MATLAB command line. If there is not a direct code to access MSE, I need an algorithm to calculate it.</p> <p>Thanks in advance.</p>
<p>Since I cannot comment I'll write an answer:</p> <p>This question has been answered here</p> <p><a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/17912481/how-to-get-neural-network-parameter-after-training">How to get neural network parameter after training?</a></p> <p>although it is not marked as such. So, now we're waiting for a moderator to remove this question as a duplicate. Also, using newfit() is not recommended since it has been obsoleted in R2010b NNET 7.0.</p>
