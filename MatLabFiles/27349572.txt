Drawing a cone surface in general equation in Matlab
<p>How can I draw a cone surface in the general equation of:</p> <pre><code>ax^2+by^2+cz^2+dxy+exz+fyz+gx+hy+iz+k=0 </code></pre> <p>in Matlab please?</p>
<p>This is not a complete answer to your question (but it's too bulky for a comment), hopefully it can help you to proceed. Regarding your concern about z=f(x,y), you can get it solving a simple quadratic equation for z:</p> <pre><code>clear all; a = - 90.53; b = @(x,y)(66.66*x - 33.67*y + 50429.65); c = @(x,y)( -11.56*x.^2 - 10.24*y.^2 + 16.43*x*y - 19156.33*x + 7731.95*y - 6899727.01); D = @(x,y)(b(x,y).^2 - 4 * a * c(x,y)); z1 = @(x,y)( ( -b(x,y) + sqrt(D(x,y) )) / (2*a) ); z2 = @(x,y)( ( -b(x,y) - sqrt(D(x,y) )) / (2*a) ); </code></pre> <p>Note that for some (x,y) your D&lt;0 and z1 and z2 will be complex, these points correspond to space outside your cone. You can select relevant subspace like</p> <pre><code>xD = -100:100; yD = arrayfun(@(x)(fzero(@(y)(D(x,y)),0.0)),xD); </code></pre> <p>Now you'll need to use define X,Y,Z matrices and use surf to plot it. Please let me know if that works, otherwise i'll give another try later.</p>
