Plotting multiple plot in one figure through loop in matlab
<p>i want to plot normal distribution plot but multiple plots in same figure through loops..For first iteration its fine i.e 3 plots in one figure but in other 3 figures it plot only one.here is the code</p> <pre><code>load iris.dat; iris; number_of_features = 4; classes = iris(:,5); number_of_classes = length(unique(classes)); for class_number = 1:number_of_classes likelihood{class_number} = struct; for feature_number = 1:number_of_features likelihood{class_number}.pd{feature_number} = fitdist(iris(find(iris(:, 5) == class_number),feature_number),'Normal'); end end hold all for feature_number = 1:number_of_features for class_number=1:number_of_classes ppd=iris(find(iris(:, 5) == class_number),feature_number); y=normpdf(ppd,likelihood{class_number}.pd{feature_number}.mu,likelihood{class_number}.pd{feature_number}.sigma); figure(feature_number) stem(ppd,y) end end </code></pre> <p>please if any one can check it and tell whats the problem in code</p>
<p>I am not sure but the code below may be work. I have just changed the place of your command.</p> <pre><code>load iris.dat; iris; number_of_features = 4; classes = iris(:,5); number_of_classes = length(unique(classes)); for class_number = 1:number_of_classes likelihood{class_number} = struct; for feature_number = 1:number_of_features likelihood{class_number}.pd{feature_number} = fitdist(iris(find(iris(:, 5) == class_number),feature_number),'Normal'); end end for feature_number = 1:number_of_features figure(feature_number) hold on for class_number=1:number_of_classes ppd=iris(find(iris(:, 5) == class_number),feature_number); y=normpdf(ppd,likelihood{class_number}.pd{feature_number}.mu,likelihood{class_number}.pd{feature_number}.sigma); stem(ppd,y) end hold off end </code></pre>
