Matlab - Using special characters in table header
<p>I have constructed a table with data from a struct and now wish to add custom headers to the columns before exporting the table. I found the following command:</p> <pre><code>T.Properties.VariableNames{'OldHeader'} = 'NewHeader'; </code></pre> <p>This command however does not allow me to use spaces or special characters for my headers. My table contains the output from processed lab data and I wish to have headers like "Vol. [mL]" and "Conc. [wt%]".</p> <p>To illustrate using the example from <a href="http://se.mathworks.com/help/matlab/ref/struct2table.html" rel="nofollow">matlab documentation</a>:</p> <pre><code>S.Name = {'CLARK';'BROWN';'MARTIN'}; S.Gender = {'M';'F';'M'}; S.SystolicBP = [124;122;130]; S.DiastolicBP = [93;80;92]; T = struct2table(S) T.Properties.VariableNames{'Gender'} = 'Sex'; </code></pre> <p>The above works, but restricts me to normal characters and no spaces. My question is how to change "Gender" to "Vol. [mL]" - if even possible?</p>
<p>As @Jubobs already mentioned in the comment, there are some rules for naming variables that prevent you from choosing the exact name that you want. From <a href="http://nl.mathworks.com/help/matlab/matlab_prog/variable-names.html" rel="nofollow">the documentation</a> that I found by googling the topic:</p> <blockquote> <p>A valid variable name starts with a letter, followed by letters, digits, or underscores. MATLABÂ® is case sensitive, so A and a are not the same variable. The maximum length of a variable name is the value that the namelengthmax command returns.</p> <p>You cannot define variables with the same names as MATLAB keywords, such as if or end. For a complete list, run the iskeyword command.</p> </blockquote> <p>However, I could think of two easy ways to work around this:</p> <ol> <li>Different names, for example you can use the variable name <code>Vol_ml</code></li> <li>Store the names in a list, perhaps with an index code like <code>v1</code> for the first variable name, then you can make <code>v1</code> the name of the first variable.</li> </ol>
