a surface plotting with inner and outer color different
<p>I am going to plot a 3D surface in matlab. I use the <code>surf</code> function, but I want to recolor it in a way that the inner surface has one color and the outer has another one. How can I do that?</p> <pre><code>A = [12 18 12 23 47 27 32 11 36 48 47 39 28 50 28] figure, surf(A) </code></pre>
<p>See if this helps,</p> <pre><code> surf(A+.01,'FaceColor',[ 1 0 1]); hold on; surf(A,'FaceColor',[ 0 0 1]); </code></pre> <p>gives, </p> <p><img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/D8ZPa.png" alt="enter image description here"></p> <p><img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/GD9Ta.png" alt="enter image description here"></p> <p>I couldn't come up with better idea! </p> <p>This is just a trick, maybe there is a way to color each side of a plane.</p>
