Double integral implementation in Matlab?
<p>I want to implement Double integral in matlab. Single integral is easy but programming for double is a bit more complicated.</p> <p>The equation to be implemented is the following:</p> <p><img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/5y330.png" alt="enter image description here"></p> <p>I have tried to implement the inner integral using the statement</p> <pre><code>t = sym('t'); a = sym('a'); pretty(int(t*((1-t)^-2.5)*((1-a*t)^-1))) </code></pre> <p>But this leads to a much bigger equation and how do I evaluate the outer integral then? Any tricks or hints regarding this?</p>
<p>I'm not quite sure about your question. The integral says that you integrate \theta out, how can it then appear in the solution? And the equation does not even depend on \theta, so it should just cancel with the \frac{1}{\pi}.</p> <p>However, if you have mistyped it and you would get a number out in the end, then I guess that numerical integration could work out for you? </p> <p>If so, the two integrals reduces to a sum and you can for instance use the function quad on one of them and the trapezoidal rule on the other one, see: <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trapezoidal_rule" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trapezoidal_rule</a>, then it would be something like:</p> <pre><code>function int = integral(f,a,b,c,d) dt = 0.001; x = a:dt:b; tempInt = zeros(length(x)); for i = 1:length(x) tempInt(i) = quad(@(y) f(x(i),y),c,d); end int = dt/2*(2*sum(tempInt)-tempInt(1)-tempInt(end)); </code></pre>
