Get MATLAB to convert a date string from Excel into the correct MATLAB serial number
<p>I have had a real headache with taking dates from Excel and putting them into MATLAB as a MATLAB serial number. They are given to me as a DateString (e.g. Date = {'20/09/2014','23/09/2014',...}). I have used the MATLAB advised <code>datenum</code> function with the following <code>dd/mm/yyyy</code> to try an direct it into that form. However, it continues to forces it into the rather unhelpful mm/dd/yyyy serial form.</p> <p>My exact code is:</p> <pre><code>Date = {'01/02/2014';'01/03/2014';'01/04/2014';'01/05/2014';'01/06/2014'} Date = datenum({'01/02/2014';'01/03/2014';'01/04/2014';'01/05/2014';'01/06/2014'},'dd/mm/yyyy'); </code></pre> <p>The results it gives me is:</p> <p><code>Date = 735601 735602 735603 735604 735605</code> i.e. they are one day apart not one month or 30-ish days.</p>
