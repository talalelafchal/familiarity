Query regarding the storage of .AVI files to FTP server or mysql server
<p>I have to design an application where the user is choosing a video and entering a secret message which will be embedded in the video.The video will be split into audio and image frames and the message will get embedded in both the audio and image frames using PGP(Pretty Good Privacy).The audio and image frames will then be combined to form a modified video. Now I have to store this modified video in a server. Then later again I have to extract this modified video from the server. Please can anyone guide me through this? Or provide me better solutions to this problem. I would appreciate that.</p>
