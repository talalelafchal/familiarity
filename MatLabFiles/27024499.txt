2 random vectors in multidimensional array
<p>I am trying t odo this:</p> <pre><code>weights = rand(64,1); % creates an array with 64 initial weights weights(:,2) = rand(40,1); % creates an array with 40 initial weights </code></pre> <p>As the code explains: fill the first vector with 64 random values and then do the same with the second vector and put them into the same variable. So I am abel to access them as so:</p> <pre><code>weights(:,1) % &lt;-- will display entire first vector weights(:,2) % &lt;-- display entire second vector </code></pre>
<p>You cannot do this, because the first call creates a matrix with <code>size(64,1)</code>. Therefore, all columns must have <code>64</code> rows, instead of your <code>40</code>.</p> <p>You can use cells instead, e.g.</p> <pre><code>weights{1} = rand(64,1); % creates an array with 64 initial weights weights{2} = rand(40,1); % creates an array with 40 initial weights </code></pre> <p>and use them like</p> <pre><code>weights{1} weights{2} </code></pre> <p>However, if this solution is useful for you depends on what you want to do else with the data.</p>
<p>A similar solution to using cells like Nemesis pointed out is structures, e.g.:</p> <pre><code>weights.a = rand(64,1); weights.b = rand(40,1); weights.a, % &lt;-- will display entire first vector weights.b, % &lt;-- will display entire second vector </code></pre> <p>I personally think the cells solution Nemesis mentioned is more useful but I guess it depends on what you're doing with it.</p>
