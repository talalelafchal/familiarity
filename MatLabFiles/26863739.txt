How to install, load CUDA driver and set Matlab to do GPU processing on my Apple Macbook Pro Retina running OS X 10.10 Yosemite?
<p>I would like to use some parallel computing function using the GPU. I tried to use gpuarray function but I have got the following error message:</p> <blockquote> <p>There is a problem with the CUDA driver or with this GPU device. Be sure that you have a supported GPU and that the latest driver is installed.</p> </blockquote> <p>Caused by:</p> <pre><code>The CUDA driver could not be loaded. </code></pre> <p>The library name used was </p> <pre><code>'/usr/local/cuda/lib/libcuda.dylib'. </code></pre> <p>The <strong>error</strong> was:</p> <pre><code>dlopen(/usr/local/cuda/lib/libcuda.dylib, 10): image not found </code></pre> <p>Therefore I would like to know how to install, load CUDA driver and set Matlab to do GPU processing on my Apple Macbook Pro Retina running OS X 10.10 Yosemite ?</p> <p>My GPU is a NVidia GeForce 750M. My Macbook Pro Retina (15") is from the late 2013 generation.</p> <p>I'm running Matlab 2014b</p> <p>Thank you for your help and support,</p> <p>Best,</p> <p>Adrien</p> <p>EDIT: thank you Robert C., I followed these instructions and Matlab with GPU seems to work fine now :)</p>
<p>I succeeded following the instructions in the CUDA <a href="http://docs.nvidia.com/cuda/cuda-getting-started-guide-for-mac-os-x/index.html#abstract" rel="nofollow">getting started guide for Mac OS</a> thanks to Robert.</p>
