How to make gif images from a set of images in matlab?
<p>How to make '.gif' image from a set of '.jpg' images (say: I1.jpg, I2.jpg,..., I10.jpg) in matlab?</p>
<p>Ok here is a simple example. I got an image with a unicorn on it and remove 2 part to create 3 different images, just for the sake of creating an animated gif. Here is what it looks like:</p> <pre><code>clear clc %// Image source: http:\\giantbomb.com A = rgb2gray(imread('Unicorn1.jpg')); B = rgb2gray(imread('Unicorn2.jpg')); C = rgb2gray(imread('Unicorn3.jpg')); ImageCell = {A;B;C}; figure; subplot(131) imshow(A) subplot(132) imshow(B) subplot(133) imshow(C) %// Just to show what the images look like (I removed spots to make sure there was an animation created): </code></pre> <p><img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/T02ys.jpg" alt="enter image description here"></p> <pre><code>%// Create file name. FileName = 'UnicornAnimation.gif'; for k = 1:numel(ImageCell) if k ==1 %// For 1st image, start the 'LoopCount'. imwrite(ImageCell{k},FileName,'gif','LoopCount',Inf,'DelayTime',1); else imwrite(ImageCell{k},FileName,'gif','WriteMode','append','DelayTime',1); end end </code></pre> <p>As you see, its not that different from the example on the Mathworks website. Here my images are in a cell array but yours might be in a regular array or something else.That should work fine; when I open 'UnicornAnimation.gif' it is indeed a nice animation! </p> <p>Hope that helps!</p>
