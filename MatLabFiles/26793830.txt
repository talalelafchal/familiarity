MATLAB wont open after java heap memory change
<p>I changed the Java heap memory from 128 MB to 4096 GB and now MATLAB will not open.</p> <p>I am using Windows 7 and I have actually had this problem before a long time ago and there was a way I could change the memory back in a file somewhere, but I cannot remember the file name or location.</p> <p>Someone please help me. I think this is a relatively simple problem. I don't understand why MATLAB wont start after increasing the java heap memory. My system has 16 GB of RAM and this doesn't make sense.</p> <p>Thanks</p>
<p>The settings file (for R2014b in Windows) lives at:</p> <pre><code>%AppData%\MathWorks\MATLAB\R2014b\matlab.prf </code></pre> <p>For Linux, and presumably also OS X:</p> <pre><code>$HOME/.matlab/R2014b/matlab.prf </code></pre> <p>You may also be able to locate the preferences file more reliably if you can launch MATLAB with the <code>-nojvm</code> option (thanks Amro):</p> <pre><code>fullfile(prefdir,'matlab.prf') % if you can get into MATLAB </code></pre> <p>The setting to look for is (example with 512 MB):</p> <pre><code>JavaMemHeapMax=I512 </code></pre> <p>Edit that and start MATLAB. If that doesn't work, backup the whole folder and start again with fresh settings.</p> <p>If you have a 32-bit installation of MATLAB, then 4096MB heap size might cause problems. Just a guess.</p>
