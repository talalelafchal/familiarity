Installation SDK 7.1
<p>I want to ask about an error I faced durring the installation of SDK 7.1 compiler in order to compile .c files under matlab, knowing that I've downloaded SDK ISO and .exe but without use, from this link <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=8279" rel="nofollow">http://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=8279</a> I'm using Matlab 2013b,Windows7 64 bit I got this error every time </p> <p>Setup could not find the file WinSDK_amd64\WinSDK_amd64.msi at any of the specified source locations G:\Setup</p>
<p>Try following the installation instructions at <a href="http://uk.mathworks.com/matlabcentral/answers/101105-how-do-i-install-microsoft-windows-sdk-7-1" rel="nofollow">How do I install Microsoft Windows SDK 7.1?</a> on the MathWorks website.</p>
<p>I have an Intel i7, Win 7 64 bit and I was able to resolve this by downloading the Windows SDK 7.1 (iso image) from this link. </p> <p><a href="http://download.microsoft.com/download/F/1/0/F10113F5-B750-4969-A255-274341AC6BCE/GRMSDKX_EN_DVD.iso" rel="nofollow">http://download.microsoft.com/download/F/1/0/F10113F5-B750-4969-A255-274341AC6BCE/GRMSDKX_EN_DVD.iso</a></p> <p>I had tried several downloads and this was the only one that actually contained the ../setup/WinSDK_amd64\WinSDK_amd64.msi file that the error message references. </p> <p>Previous to finding this download I had tried removing every single instance of the C++ redistributable for each version of Visual studio I had installed. This alone did not work, because the other Win 7 SDK downloads I tried did not contain the ../setup/WinSDK_amd64\WinSDK_amd64.msi file that the error message references. </p>
