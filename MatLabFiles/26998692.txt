MATLAB: Error in fig2texPS
<p>I want to use fig2texPS to export plots from MATLAB to LaTeX. I copied the the script to D:\Eigene Dokumente\MATLAB\fig2TexPS and added this folder as a path in MATLAB. Unfortunately, I receive the following error:</p> <pre><code>&gt;&gt; fig2texPS() Undefined function 'find' for input arguments of type 'matlab.graphics.chart.primitive.Line'. Error in fig2texPS (line 526) lsh = double(find(handle(lshandles),'-class','graph2d.lineseries')); % find plots </code></pre> <p>PS: I use a version of the script which was updated in order to work with pdtlatex (<a href="http://pastebin.com/xK6KxxBT" rel="nofollow">http://pastebin.com/xK6KxxBT</a>) that I found in the MATLAB Central File Exchange. The same error also occurs when I use the original script.</p>
<p>This might not be the answer you are looking for, but there is the marvelous <a href="http://www.mathworks.com/matlabcentral/fileexchange/22022-matlab2tikz" rel="nofollow">matlab2tikz</a> that does the job of conversion of figures quite nicely, which you could use as an alternative to fig2texPS.</p>
<p>I also use the function <code>fig2texPS.m</code> and it works very well. It might be an answer for your question to use an older version of Matlab. I am using 2013b and it works. While I have tried this function with Matlab 2015a, I was getting the same error message.</p> <p>I hope my answer helps you with your problems.</p>
