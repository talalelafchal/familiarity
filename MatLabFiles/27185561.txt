Change of index in for loop Matlab
<p>I have a loop like this :</p> <pre><code> for i = 1:3 M = 1 for M = M:12 while (S(M) == i) M = M+1 end end end </code></pre> <p>Now for the new incremented value of M in while loop the 'for' loop is not working for this new value. Any solutions?</p>
<p>The code doesn't make any sense!</p> <p>You should start to use different names for your parameters,</p> <p>And note that:</p> <pre><code>for index = values program statements : end </code></pre> <blockquote> <p>Avoid assigning a value to the index variable within the body of a loop. The for statement overrides any changes made to the index within the loop.</p> </blockquote> <p>For the second loop <code>for M = M : 12</code> is the same as <code>for M = 1 : 12</code>.</p> <p>MATLAB takes the <em>index</em> values at their first definition, for example,</p> <pre><code>a = [1 2]; for i = a disp(i); a = [1 2 3]; end </code></pre> <p>You will see that <code>i</code> won't accept the value <code>3</code> because at the first use of <code>for</code>, <code>i</code> is set over <code>[1 2]</code>.</p>
