Matlab GUI: Do I need to pass hObject AND handles?
<p>I am fairly new to writing GUIs in Matlab and noticed that when passing information between callbacks usually two values <code>hObject</code> and <code>handles</code> are passed.</p> <p>From what I read and understood, <code>hObject</code> is the handle to an object which contains the real data (or at least handles to it) and <code>handles</code> is not itself a handle, but a struct reproducing the structure of objects "behind" <code>hObject</code>. Changing (or adding to) <code>handles</code> does not change the real data as it is seen from the calling function but a local copy. To actually write the changed data into the object pointed to by <code>hObject</code> I need to call <code>guidata(hObject, handles)</code>.</p> <p>Is this right so far or did I get something wrong?</p> <p>I also read that I can create struct similar to <code>handles</code> by calling <code>handles = guidata(hObject)</code>.</p> <p><strong>So is there any point in passing both <code>hObject</code> and <code>handles</code> to one of my own functions instead of just passing <code>hObject</code> and creating <code>handles</code> locally?</strong></p>
<p>You are correct so far. The input parameter <code>handles</code> is a handy way of keeping track of all the components of the UI. As a standard <code>handles</code> is not an input parameter. But if you use <code>guide</code> it will set is as an extra parameter as follows by setting for example the <code>Callback</code> option to the anonymous function <code>@(hObject,eventdata)guitest('pushbutton1_Callback',hObject,eventdata,guidata(hObject))</code>. This can of course just as easily be done in the code for the function by <code>handles = guidata(hObject)</code>.</p> <p>Usually you will not need to change in the <code>handles</code> (only in the objects they refer to), but if you need to change something in the <code>handles</code> (for example if you use it to store more than just the <code>handles</code> for the UI elements) it is important to call <code>guidata(hObject, handles)</code> to actually save the changes.</p> <p>So the short answer to you question is: no, you can just as well retrieve the <code>handles</code> yourself when you need them.</p>
