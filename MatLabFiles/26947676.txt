How to solve equality equation through matlab solver?
<p>I have a question related to basic mathematics, but with Matlab solving method. Here is the question:</p> <pre><code>y = 5; for x=0.01:100 F = 3*x + y - 2*x^2; end </code></pre> <p>From the above iterative equation I want to find the max [F] value and its relative [x]. Is it possible to solve it through matlab solvers. Could you please help me to solve this problem?</p>
<p>For unconstrained non-linear optimization (according to your last edit) use <a href="http://www.mathworks.com/help/optim/ug/fminsearch.html" rel="nofollow"><code>fminsearch</code></a> to solve your problem. It would be something like this:</p> <pre><code>F = @(x) 3*x + y - 2*x^2; xini = 5; %initial value to the solver [xsolu Fsolu] = fminsearch(@F,xini) </code></pre> <p>To control the options, parameters of solver see <a href="http://www.mathworks.com/help/matlab/ref/optimset.html" rel="nofollow"><code>optimset</code></a></p> <pre><code>opts = optimset('MaxFunEvals',10e4, 'MaxIter', 10e4) [xsolu Fsolu] = fminsearch(@F,xini, opts) </code></pre> <hr> <p>The solution according to your original formulation would be:</p> <pre><code>x=0.01:100; F = zeros(length(x),1); for ii = 1:length(x) F(i) = 3*x(i) + y - 2*x(i)^2; end xsolu = max(F); Fsolu = F(x == xsolu); </code></pre> <p>Which is quite inefficient approach, to say nothing more.</p>
