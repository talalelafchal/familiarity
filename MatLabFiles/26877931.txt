how to solve first order partial differential equation in matlab
<p>I have the first order partial differential equation:</p> <pre><code>N0(t) + dN[N(d,t)R(d)/dy = dN(d,t)/dt </code></pre> <p>with intitial condition:</p> <pre><code>t= 0, N(d,0) = 0 </code></pre> <p>and boundary condition:</p> <pre><code>d=0, N(0,t)=0 </code></pre> <p>if someone know how to solve, can you please help me? </p>
<p>try <a href="http://www.mathworks.com/help/matlab/ref/ode45.html" rel="nofollow"><code>ode45</code></a></p> <p>Also:</p> <p>1) avoid variables like <code>d</code>: as you have it as an operator it will bring confusion</p> <p>2) make sure you have an <strong>ODE</strong> and not <strong>PDE</strong> (what does <code>dy</code> and <strong>boundary condition</strong> stands for?)</p>
