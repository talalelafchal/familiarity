plotting ilaplace output MATLAB
<p>I'm trying to plot the transfer function in time domain - h, when I run the following code I get an error:</p> <pre><code>syms s; H=((1+2*s)*1.943)/(s*(s^2)*(1+0.15*s)+((1+2*s)*1.943)); h = ilaplace(H); ezplot(h); </code></pre> <p>I read the help on ilaplace and understood it returns a sym function. what am I missing? </p> <p>I tried to look up on the internet and I didn't find an example that perform what I want without errors.</p> <p>if it is relevant I'm using 7.12.0 (R2011a)</p> <p>thanks</p>
<p>If you look at the expression for <code>h</code>, I bet you'll find it's not a straightforward expression of <code>t</code>, and it's not something that can be plotted by MATLAB due to the complexity of the equation. You might want to try substituting some numerical values of <code>t</code> with <a href="http://uk.mathworks.com/help/symbolic/subs.html" rel="nofollow"><code>subs</code></a> to get the corresponding values of <code>h</code>, which you could then plot using the <code>plot</code> command, but I don't know if this will work owing to the complexity of the inverse Laplace transform expression.</p>
