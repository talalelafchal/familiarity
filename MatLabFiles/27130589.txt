MATLAB: symbolic integral of symfun
<p>I wish to perform a symbolic integration over time; the code is given below.</p> <pre><code>syms x1 u1 t x1 = symfun(sym('x1(t)'), [t]); x1dot = p1 + p4*p8 - p13*x1; int(x1dot,t) </code></pre> <p>The answer should be:</p> <pre><code>e^(-p13*t)*x1(0)+(p1 + p4*p8)/(-p13)*[1-e^(-p13*t)] </code></pre> <p>what I get is:</p> <pre><code>Warning: Explicit integral could not be found. ans(t) = int(p1 - p13*x1(t) + p4*p8*u1(t), t) </code></pre> <p>It seems to me that it does not recognize that <code>x1dot</code> is the derivative of <code>x1</code>. How can I solve this issue?</p>
<p>What you are trying to do is not strictly speaking integration, i.e. from a known function <code>f(t)</code> deduce a function <code>F(t)</code> such that the derivative of <code>F</code> is <code>f</code>. The original function is not really known, since it depends on itself (no matter how trivial the relationship might seem to a human, you need to inverse it).</p> <p>It is rather solving a differential equation, <a href="http://fr.mathworks.com/help/symbolic/dsolve.html" rel="nofollow">for which <code>dsolve</code> is probably the way to go</a>. MATLAB has no way to guess that <code>x1dot</code> is the derivative of <code>x1</code>. I guess you could declare <code>x1dot=diff(x1)</code> but why not use <code>diff(x1)</code> directly where needed ?</p>
