Using save to create a new file with user's input (MATLAB)
<p>I'm making a code, and I've used the input function to get the name the user wants for the new file, but I do not know how to use save with said name.</p> <p>I've tried something like this:</p> <pre><code>matrix = [1 2 3; 4 5 6] name = input ('Name your new file &gt; ', 's') save ('name.txt', 'matrix' ) </code></pre> <p>which obviously creates a file with the name 'name'.. Thanks!</p>
<p><code>save (strcat(name,'.txt'), 'matrix' )</code> didn't work for me, the file was created but didn't have <code>matrix</code> in it.</p> <p>I could get the desired results with the following code,</p> <pre><code>matrix = [1 2 3; 4 5 6]; name = input ('Name your new file &gt; ', 's'); dlmwrite([name,'.txt'],matrix, 'delimiter', '\t','newline', 'pc'); </code></pre>
