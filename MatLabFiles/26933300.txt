In Matlab, is there a way to quickly import a folder of images into a matrix?
<p>Right now I'm using a for loop to import images into a matrix, where the columns are the RGB representation of said images. Here's my code:</p> <pre><code>for i=1:num_data_points filename = sprintf('train/%d.png', i) X(:,i)=reshape(imread(filename), [], 1); end </code></pre> <p>My problem is that it's taking a really long time to import unless I'm using a small number of images (100-200), but since I'm using the CIFAR-10 dataset I would like to import the entire training set (10,000 images).</p> <p>Is there a faster way of doing this?</p>
