Romania's Cities Breadth-First Search using matlab
<p>i working on a project that referred to romania cities Breadth-First Search: </p> <p><a href="http://centurion2.com/AIHomework/Searching/RomaniaMap.JPG" rel="nofollow">romania cities map</a></p> <p>i have a function for creating the neighbors: </p> <pre><code>function [NeighborName PathLength StraightLineDistance] = makeneighbor(x,y,z) NeighborName=x; PathLength=y; % distance from current city to neighbor StraightLineDistance=z; % i want to use it for a* model </code></pre> <p>and in my 'main.m' i have defined city* and neighboes:</p> <pre><code>clc;clear; city1='Arad' [neighbor_name neighbor_distance straight_line_distance]=makeneighbor('Zerind',75,374) [neighbor_name neighbor_distance straight_line_distance]=makeneighbor('Sibiu',140,253) [neighbor_name neighbor_distance straight_line_distance]=makeneighbor('Timisoara',118,329) city2='Zerind' [neighbor_name neighbor_distance straight_line_distance]=makeneighbor('Oradea',71,380) [neighbor_name neighbor_distance straight_line_distance]=makeneighbor('Arad',75,366) . . . city20='Neamt' [neighbor_name neighbor_distance straight_line_distance]=makeneighbor('Iasi',87,226) </code></pre> <p>each time compare the city with bucharest </p> <pre><code>if city*=='bucharest' break; else list= add the city to list. </code></pre> <p>for next time i need to compare its neighbor with goal and each time if city ~= 'bucharest' add that city to list. also when find the goal, add goal to list.</p> <p>now i need a function to find bucharest and putting previous cities in an array. automatically find cities and them values. like this: </p> <pre><code>path1=['arad' 'sibiu' 'fagaras' 'bucharest']; distance1=[140 99 211]; path2=['arad' 'zerind' 'oradea' 'sibiu' 'fagaras' 'bucharest']; distance2=[75 71 151 99 211]; path3=['arad' 'zerind' 'oradea' 'sibiu' 'vilcea' 'pitesti' 'bucharest']; distance3=[75 71 151 80 97 101]; . . pathN=[city1:cityN 'bucharest']; distanceN=[distance1:distanceN] disp('please explain very simple. im not so expert in matlab, and my primary language is not english. many thanx...') </code></pre>
