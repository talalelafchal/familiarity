Error - Index exceeds matrix dimensions
<p>I have the following portion:</p> <pre><code>N = size(p,1); x = 1:N; y = x; [X,Y] = meshgrid(x,y); R = sqrt((2.*X-N-1).^2+(2.*Y-N-1).^2)/N; Theta = atan2((N-1-2.*Y+2),(2.*X-N+1-2)); R = (R&lt;=1).*R; Rad = radialpoly(R,n,m); Product = p(x,y).*Rad.*exp(-1i*m*Theta); </code></pre> <p>I get the error in the following line:</p> <pre><code>Product = p(x,y).*Rad.*exp(-1i*m*Theta); </code></pre> <p>The error that I get is:</p> <pre><code>Index exceeds matrix dimensions. </code></pre> <p>I tried to "debug" the program, and found that the dimensions issue may be due to the following line:</p> <p>[X,Y] = meshgrid(x,y);</p> <p>The weird thing is that the program doesn't give me errors on most of the images I'm applying it on.</p> <p>Do you know why I'm getting such error?</p> <p>Thanks.</p>
<p>first of all, it would be nice to see how you assign your <code>p</code> variable.</p> <p>to make sure that you the <code>size(y)==size(p)</code> try</p> <pre><code>assert(size(p,1) == size(p,2) ) </code></pre> <p>or</p> <pre><code>assert(N == size(p,2) ) </code></pre> <p>if it returns an error, then your <code>p</code> is not square.</p> <hr> <p>if you know beforehand that you have a rectangular (non-square) array, assign your <code>y</code> correspondingly:</p> <pre><code>x = 1:size(p, 1) y = 1:size(p, 2) ... %// and maybe dependent on what you do: N = min(size(p)) </code></pre> <p>this will make sure it does not exceed size of <code>p</code> when indexing it along the second dimension</p>
