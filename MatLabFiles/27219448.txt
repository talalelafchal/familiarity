Does the chessboard pattern need to remain the same after a camera has been calibrated?
<p>Does the chessboard pattern need to remain constant after the camera has been calibrated? In other words, if I calibrate with a 9x6 block board with 25mm square blocks, can I use a 32 mm square 9x6 board with the same intrinsic matrix? Does it effect the focal length, and if so, why/how?</p>
<p>Once you calibrate, you can use any checkerboard to localize your camera. In fact, you can use any set of reference points with known 3D world coordinates, as long as you can accurately detect them in the image. The <code>extrinsics</code> function in the Computer Vision System Toolbox takes a set of image points and a set of corresponding world points, regardless of where they come from.</p>
