Patternsearch discrete variables
<p>I want to optimize a multi-variable function with the <code>patternsearch</code> function in MATLAB. The function requires a lower and upper boundary and looks within the boundaries in a continuous domain. </p> <p>I however have a discrete set of values in an excel file and would like the algorithm to search within this discrete domain instead of in the continuous domain. </p> <p>Is this possible with <code>patternsearch</code>? </p>
<p>Maybe I don't understand correctly your question but if you have a (discret and finite) set of values, why don't you compute the function's value at these points and return the minium?</p>
<p>In short, no. That is not what <code>patternsearch</code> is intended for. Optimization techniques for discrete and continuous search spaces are quite expectedly different.</p> <p>If you're looking for an approximate answer however, it is possible to use <code>spline</code>, <code>polyfit</code>, etc. to arrive at an approximate continuous function for your data and then apply <code>patternsearch</code> on it.</p> <p>If you provide greater detail about your problem, I or someone else may be able to suggest a more suitable way of working with your data.</p>
<p>The best optimization tool for this is the <strong>Genetic Algorithm</strong>. This optimization tool comes with Matlab's global optimization toolbox and allows for optimization of both continuous and discrete variables at the same time.</p> <p>In the genetic algorithm variables that are integers have to be declared as such. Non-declared variables are continuous by default.</p> <p>Check the Global Optimization Toolbox guide for information on how it works: <a href="http://it.mathworks.com/help/pdf_doc/gads/gads_tb.pdf" rel="nofollow">http://it.mathworks.com/help/pdf_doc/gads/gads_tb.pdf</a>.</p>
