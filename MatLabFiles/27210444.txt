assigning a string to string to an array using matlab
<p>I am having issues assigning a string to an array for example if I have Test = [11 12]</p> <pre><code>for ii=1:1:endofloop if Test(ii) == 11 Test(ii) = 'J'; end end </code></pre> <p>The output of this results in [74 12], How do i make it to output [J 12] instead of [74,12] I have tried the char function but it doesn't work. Any help is appreciated</p>
<p>Your difficulty lies in <code>74</code> being the <a href="http://www.asciitable.com/" rel="nofollow">ascii character code</a> of <code>J</code>. I don't believe you can mix strings and integers in a vector. However, if J is symbolic and not needed as a string but instead is representative of a value you could do this</p> <pre><code>syms J; % Not a string 'J' but rather a symbolic value. An 'x' so to speak for ii=1:1:endofloop if Test(ii) == 11 Test(ii) = J; end end </code></pre> <p>and then later replace J for a value using <a href="http://www.mathworks.com/help/symbolic/subs.html" rel="nofollow">subs</a> where you would do something like </p> <pre><code>subs(Test,J,value) % value is somewhere earlier defined </code></pre> <p>If however, you actually want to use a mixed array Adiel is right in recommending a cell array.</p> <p>If you are just using this as a translation script, say where <code>J=11</code> and <code>K=12</code> then I would recommend using a separate datastructure to hold your translated value, for instance a simple string. Example:</p> <pre><code>s = ''; for ii=1:1:endofloop if Test(ii) == 11 s = strcat(s,'J'); end if Test(ii) == 12 s = strcat(s,'K'); end end </code></pre>
