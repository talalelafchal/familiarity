MATLAB R2014b: Rendering plots with lines in the same place
<p>Since version R2014b, MATLAB now renders graphics nicely anti-aliased (finally!)</p> <p>However, this causes a glitch in the way it displays some of my figures. If I plot a line, use <code>hold on</code> and then plot another line in exactly the same place with a different colour, the line appears in a mottled combination of both colours. In the past, the line would simply appear as the <em>last</em> colour that was plotted in that location.</p> <p>Here's an example of a trace in blue, with some sections (the steeper bits) showing a green line. In previous MATLAB versions, the green lines would be continuous, but now some of the blue line shows through.</p> <p><img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/nUSBn.jpg" alt="enter image description here"></p> <p>Is there a neat way to work around this in the new version, or do I have to ensure that I remove any existing lines before plotting in the same place?</p>
<p>When overplotting, the new anti aliasing plots can have some bleed through, try</p> <p><code>set(gcf,'GraphicsSmoothing','off')</code></p> <p>To see if it restores the functionality you're used to.</p> <p>Ref: <a href="http://www.mathworks.com/matlabcentral/answers/157758-how-do-i-turn-off-antialiasing-in-matlab-r2014b" rel="nofollow">http://www.mathworks.com/matlabcentral/answers/157758-how-do-i-turn-off-antialiasing-in-matlab-r2014b</a></p>
