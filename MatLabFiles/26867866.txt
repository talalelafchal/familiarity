Adding to MATLAB gif images using imwrite() (white images beyond certain point)
<p>I've tried finding the answer to this all over the place, but I've had no luck so far. You see, I've ran into a problem where I'm generating gif files by appending images into a single gif using a for loop. But after a while, imwrite seems to stop actually adding the images into the gif file - it just adds white spaces instead. </p> <p>So, the file itself is large enough (250MB) to feasibly have the right number of images in, but when I open it and play it, once it gets past a certain point I just have white images. I'm pretty damn sure it's nothing to do with the for loop itself - I've had it print out the image file it's working on for each loop iteration and that's correct. The filenames are all correct. </p> <p>It just seems to give up after a certain number of images, so my thought is that maybe there's a maximum number? I have over 50 frames that I want to stitch together.</p> <p>The code snippet I'm working on:</p> <pre><code>delay_time = 0; % for each frequency, read in the iso-contour and stitch to the plots % together to make a gif for counter_frequency = freq_min:freq_inc:freq_max im_in = imread(['2D FFT, ' num2str(counter_frequency, '%3.2f') ' GHz.png'], 'png'); [imind,cm] = rgb2ind(im_in,256); disp([num2str(counter_frequency)]); if counter_frequency == freq_min imwrite(imind,cm,[directory.plot.iso_plots '\Iso-frequency Animation.gif'],'gif','DelayTime',delay_time,'LoopCount',inf); else imwrite(imind,cm,[directory.plot.iso_plots '\Iso-frequency Animation.gif'],'gif','DelayTime',delay_time,'WriteMode','append'); end; end; </code></pre>
<p>Solved it! There was nothing wrong with my code after all - it was the program I was using to view the gif! Internet explorer is a bad idea guys. Always. Can't believe I forgot that! Found out the computer I was using for the coding had Chrome, opened it in Chrome out of curiosity - and it was fine. </p> <p>Damn you, IE!</p>
