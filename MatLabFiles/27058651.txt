why are matlab symbolic calculations so slow?
<p>I was testing with the symbolic toolbox of Matlab. And wonder why it is so slow even when just calculating with symbolic numbers. To test it I wrote this</p> <pre><code>syms x x = subs(x,1); a = 1; tic for i=1:10000 z_sym = x + 1; end toc tic for i=1:10000 z_num = a + 1; end toc </code></pre> <p>For the first loop it says <code>Elapsed time is 4.358483 seconds.</code> and for the second on <code>Elapsed time is 0.000029 seconds.</code>. I know using the subs function gives me x=1 but it’s still of the typ <code>sym</code> and I could convert it with a cast to speed things up. But that’s the point. </p> <p>Why it takes around 15000 times longer to calculate 1+1 symbolic than it takes numeric. What is slowing Matlab so hard?</p>
