Inverse Fourier transform and signal reconstruction
<p>I'm applying what's called a Wiener filter to a heart beat ECG signal. My problem is the Fourier and inverse Fourier transform which in theory should be easy. After getting Pxx and Pxxn. PSDs for a constructed desired signal and a the noise in our signal shifted so zero frequency in center. which I'm pretty sure I got right.</p> <pre><code>% frequency response function for z= 1:Nfft Hf(z)=Pxx(z)/(Pxx(z)+(Pxxn(z))); end % fourier transform on one ecg cycle ecgf=fftshift(abs(fft(ecg(100:800),Nfft))); % getting the output signal Yf=ecgf.*Hf; figure; plot(f,Yf,'green'); % inverse fourier transform Y=real(ifft(fftshift((Yf)),Nfft)); figure; plot(Y); </code></pre> <p>What am I doing wrong? and can the output length of ifft be changed to what 700 to match the input signal or not.</p>
