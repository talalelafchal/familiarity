MATLAB filtering a signal results in NaN
<p>I am loading a wav file into matlab and trying to implement a sound Equalizer <br /> I am using many bandpass filters on different regions in order to implement some effects on the sound<br/> This is an example of part of the code :</p> <pre><code>[b3,a3]=butter(6,[300 500]/22050,'bandpass'); [b4,a4]=butter(6,[750 1250]/22050,'bandpass'); </code></pre> <p>These filters are realized correctly and I got the corresponding coefficients<br /> However, when i try to filter the signal, i get that f3 is NaN for all entries, whereas f4 is correctly computed! I checked that my input wav file doesn't have NaN entries, and this is clear since f4 was a success. This is the code I'm using to read the file and to use the filters:</p> <pre><code>x=wavread('sampleseg (1).wav'); f3= filter(b3,a3,x); f4= filter(b4,a4,x); </code></pre> <p>Any idea what can i do to solve this? Any help is appreciated :)</p>
