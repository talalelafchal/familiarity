Open and close GUI in for loop
<p>Why does the following work perfectly fine if I step through using the debugger, but produces an error on the second run when run on its own?</p> <pre><code>for i = 1:2 clear f; cftool; //Call fitting toolbox GUI drawnow; f = findall(0,'Type','Figure'); waitfor(f(1)); end </code></pre> <p>Edit: introducing pause(0.1) after the waitfor(f(1)) solves the problem, but conceptually makes no difference to me, the loop should stop anyway after waitfor, shouldn't it?</p>
<p>How about the following?</p> <pre><code>for i = 1:2 if exist('f','var')==1 clear f; end cftool; //Call fitting toolbox GUI drawnow; f = findall(0,'Type','Figure'); waitfor(f(1)); end </code></pre>
