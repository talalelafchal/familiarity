Verify convolution theorem in fourier transform - MATLAB
<p>The convolution theorem in fourier transform said:</p> <p>F(f.g) = F(f) * F(g)</p> <p>I am trying to verify this by using fft2() in Matlab.</p> <p>Assume there are two matrix A and B (size 10x10):</p> <pre><code>A = [zeros(4, 10); ones(2, 10); zeros(4, 10)]; % matrix A B = A'; % matrix B Left = fft2(A .* B); % F(f.g) Right = conv2(fft2(A), fft2(B), 'same') % F(f) * F(g) </code></pre> <p>The Left should be equal to Right according to the convolution theorem, but in this case Left and Right are not identical. Any idea what the problem is? Thanks. </p>
