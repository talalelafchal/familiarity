converge values to range [-pi,pi] in matlab, NOT using wraptopi
<p>The assignment is: <strong>Reset the values stored in the matrix accordingly, so that they lie within this range [-pi,pi]. Take care not to use any non-standard Matlab function(s) to do this.</strong></p> <p>(of course are all angles theta + 2n*pi the same, for any integer n. Therefore for example: an angle of 1.5*pi should be reset to -0.5*pi.)</p> <p>The nonstandard matlabfunction wraptopi does this (I think), but I am not allowed to use this function. I've got the feeling that I could use modulo to do this, but I don't know how.</p> <p>Could anyone help me please?</p> <p>Thanks in advance</p>
<p>To expand on @Ben Voight, you could use modulo-style operations this way:</p> <p>To wrap to [0, 2*pi], you'd do this:</p> <pre><code>angle_rad = angle_rad - 2*pi*floor(angle_rad/(2*pi)); </code></pre> <p>To wrap to [-pi, +pi], you'd add another term</p> <pre><code>angle_rad = angle_rad - 2*pi*floor( (angle_rad+pi)/(2*pi) ); </code></pre>
