how to draw oval shape around objects in image
<p>I want to draw oval shape around cells in a binary image. So far I tried the code shown below to draw ellipses around cells in a binary image. In code, IBord is the binary image.Code draws ellipse shape successfully around cells. </p> <pre><code>s = regionprops(IBord, 'Orientation', 'MajorAxisLength', 'MinorAxisLength', 'Eccentricity', 'Centroid'); figure(2); imshow(IBord) phi = linspace(0,2*pi,50); cosphi = cos(phi); sinphi = sin(phi); for k = 1:length(s) xbar = s(k).Centroid(1); ybar = s(k).Centroid(2); a = s(k).MajorAxisLength/2; b = s(k).MinorAxisLength/2; theta = pi*s(k).Orientation/180; R = [ cos(theta) sin(theta) -sin(theta) cos(theta)]; xy = [a*cosphi;b*sinphi]; xy = R*xy; X = xy(1,:) + xbar; Y = xy(2,:) + ybar; plot(X,Y,'r','LineWidth',2); end </code></pre> <p>kindly suggest how can i modify this code to draw oval shape (egg like shape) around cells in a binary image.</p>
<p>One way to achieve this effect is to use smaller exponents on <code>cosphi</code> and <code>sinphi</code>. </p> <pre><code>gam = .8 xy = [a * sign(cosphi) .* abs(cosphi).^gam; b * sign(sinphi) .* abs(sinphi).^gam]; </code></pre> <p>Play around with <code>gam</code>. This should give more oval-ly shapes.</p>
