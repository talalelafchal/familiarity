Extention of markov chain from first order to second order?
<p>Below is my matlab code snippet for generating first order markov chain. I am having trouble with extending to 2nd order markov chain. Can some one help me in doing so? Any suggestions, hints, links, pseudo-code, algorithm, python or matlab snippets would be helpful.</p> <p><code>cdist</code> is the cumulative distribution vector (size-28*1) my 27 symbols. I am writing the output to file called <code>chain</code>.<code>p</code> and <code>q</code> are uniform random numbers. <code>CTRANS</code> is the cumulative matrix corresponding to my first order transition matrix <code>TRANS</code> (which is not shown here, its size is 729*27). <code>CTRANS</code> besides being the cumulative version also has a row vector of zeros appended on top for programming ease. <code>cols</code> is the column size of <code>CTRANS</code>.</p> <pre><code>%generate sequence according to distribution and transition matrix fileID = fopen('chain','w'); for k=1:10000 p=rand; for l=2:numel(cdist)%2 to 28 if ((p &gt;= cdist(l-1)) &amp;&amp; (p &lt;= cdist(l))) fprintf(fileID,'%s\n',num2str(l-1)); q=rand; for m=2:cols%2 to 28 if ((q &gt;= CTRANS(l,m-1)) &amp;&amp; (q &lt;= CTRANS(l,m))) fprintf(fileID,'%s\n',num2str(m-1)); end end end end end fclose(fileID); </code></pre> <p>I am struggling with the second order case. I can provide more details if required. My input data from where I extract the statistics is english text of length around 4000 characters. I have removed the punctuations etc and converted capital letters to small letters, so now there are 27 symbols where number 1 represents 'a' till 26 represents 'z' and 27 for space. Also I have created the bi-gram distribution vector for the second order case.</p>
