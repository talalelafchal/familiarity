Matlab fscanf, fseek, and fread in Python
<p>I have a Matlab code that I am trying to convert into Python. I have a binary output from a Fortran program which is read into Matlab using fread, fscanf and fseek. I would like to convert this into python, however I have not had any luck. Here is a sample from the Matlab script;</p> <pre><code>[fid,message]=fopen(fname,'r'); junk=' '; while junk(1)~='P' junk=fscanf(fid,'%s',1); end fseek(fid,-length(junk),0); while ((sign~='+')&amp;(sign~='-')) sign=char(fread(fid,1)); end fread(fid,2,'float'); fc=fread(fid,1,'float'); fread(fid,2,'float'); sd=fread(fid,1,'float'); </code></pre> <p>Any help would be appreciated.</p>
