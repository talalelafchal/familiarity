translating matlab code into python
<pre><code>function [b1,b2,b3] = loglinsolve(a,b,d) syms alpha beta delta css kss b1 b2 b3 alpha = a; beta = b; delta = d; kss = ((((1/beta)+ alpha * delta - 1)/(1-alpha)) + delta)^alpha; css = (((1/beta)+ alpha * delta - 1)/(1-alpha))*kss; xss = [css,css,kss]; param = [alpha,beta,delta]; res = foc(xss,param); eps = 0.0001 * abs(css); x1 = [css+eps,css,kss]; res1 = foc(x1,param); b1 = (res1 - res)/eps; yss = [css,css+eps,kss]; res2 = foc(yss,param); b2 = (res2-res)/eps; eps1 = 0.0001 * abs(kss); zss = [css,css,kss+eps1]; res3 = foc(zss,param); b3 = (res3-res)/eps1; return; </code></pre> <p>I need to translate this code into python. My following homework are building off this code. I could not figure it out so I bought matlab and worked with my friend to do it. However, not a fan of matlab and would like to figure out how to get this to work in python.</p>
