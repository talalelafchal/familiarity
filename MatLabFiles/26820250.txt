How to project data on a certain direction
<p>For example, I have 2 data set, both of them are in 2-D. Now the question is how to project these two data on a linear equation.</p> <pre><code>%%% Here is the data %%% %%% The data are Gaussian distributed with means m1 and m2, %%% %%% and have a common covariance matrix C %%% m1 = [0 3]'; %%% mean of data set 1 m2 = [3 2.5]'; %%% mean of data set 2 C1 = [2 1;1 2]; %%% covariance matrix %%% C2 = [2 1;1 2]; %%% covariance matrix %%% X1 = mvnrnd(m1,C1,N); X2 = mvnrnd(m2,C2,N); plot(X1(:,1),X1(:,2),'bx',X2(:,1),X2(:,2),'ro'); grid on </code></pre>
<p>Here is a solution assuming that you want orthogonal projection to a line. Probably not the most efficient implementation, but at least the steps are easy to understand.</p> <p>The line is defined by <code>a</code> and <code>b</code> parameters as: y = a*x + b;</p> <pre><code>N = 3; %%% Here is the data %%% %%% The data are Gaussian distributed with means m1 and m2, %%% %%% and have a common covariance matrix C %%% m1 = [0 3]'; %%% mean of data set 1 m2 = [3 2.5]'; %%% mean of data set 2 C1 = [2 1;1 2]; %%% covariance matrix %%% C2 = [2 1;1 2]; %%% covariance matrix %%% X1 = mvnrnd(m1,C1,N); X2 = mvnrnd(m2,C2,N); figure plot(X1(:,1),X1(:,2),'bx',X2(:,1),X2(:,2),'rx'); grid on axis equal % equation of the line % y = a*x + b a = 1; b = 1; % normalized directional vector of the line s = [a, a^2]; s = s./norm(s); % translate points for easier work X1(:,2) = X1(:,2)-b; X2(:,2) = X2(:,2)-b; % projection X1p = (X1*s')*s; X2p = (X2*s')*s; % tranlate the points back X1p(:,2) = X1p(:,2)+b; X2p(:,2) = X2p(:,2)+b; xx = -4:8; hold on plot(xx, a*xx+b, 'green') plot(X1p(:,1),X1p(:,2),'bo',X2p(:,1),X2p(:,2),'ro') xlabel('x') ylabel('y') title('Orthogonal projection') </code></pre> <p><code>x</code> is the original point while <code>o</code> is its projection. <img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/cFTBg.png" alt="enter image description here"></p>
