Magnitude and phase response still possible to use Matlab's bode function?
<p>I have the magnitude and phase response of a system. Now I can plot the bode easily using <code>semilogx(frequency,abs(response))</code> (magnitude) and <code>semilogx(frequency,angle(response))</code> (phase). However I was wondering if it is possible to use Matlab's <code>bode</code> function. Such as <code>bode(frequency,response)</code></p> <p>The reason I like Matlab's <code>bode</code> function is not mainly because it can calculate the magnitude and phase response but also because it provides 2 nice plotting functions which I really like. </p> <ol> <li>You are able to select to only the response of a single input-output.</li> <li>You are able to select to only show for example the magnitude or phase response.</li> </ol> <p>So does someone know if this is possible? I guess somewhere there is a function which handles the plotting capabilities of the <code>bode</code> function.</p> <hr> <p>I figured out that I can create a n x m bode plot using <code>h = resppack.bodeplot([n,m]);</code> and I can plot the MIMO response using <code>h.plot(freq',abs(resp)',angle(resp)');</code></p> <p>But I do not yet have the abilities to select a response or choose to only show magnitude or phase response.</p>
<p>You can use <code>frd</code> to create a frequency response data model from a frequency response. For that, you will have to create a frequency response with <code>freqz</code> from your data. Then you should be able to use <code>bode(frd)</code>, as you would usually.</p>
