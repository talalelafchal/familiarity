Table-like subplot with labels in X and Y
<p>I am trying to plot some figures in a table like way.</p> <p>so e.g. I have 3x4 grid of subplots (each one is a surf) and I want to have labels in the X and Y axis, something like:</p> <pre><code> thingy1 thingy2 thingy3 a1 sp341 sp342 ... a2 ... ... ... a3 ... ... ... a4 ... ... ... </code></pre> <p>where <code>sp341</code> means <code>subplot(3,4,1)</code>. To do this, I tried for <code>thingyN</code> using <code>title</code> and for <code>aN</code> using 'ylabel' (I view the surfs from z, so it works). This give me some nice results. </p> <p>However, I also want <code>axis off</code>, so only the surface is seen! (what an annoying guy I am). As you may suspect, this also deletes the ylabels, with the axis.</p> <p>Any way of workaround-ing this? I just need it for reporting purposes, so it doesnt need to be a general solution, an "ugly" way of solving it may work (as using ylabel is).</p>
<p>The <code>axis off</code> command hides the labels, but does not delete them.<br> In order for them to appear you should do something like that:</p> <pre><code>h1 = ylabel('a1'); . . . hN = ylabel('aN'); axis off set(h1,'Visible','on') . . . set(hN,'Visible','on') </code></pre>
