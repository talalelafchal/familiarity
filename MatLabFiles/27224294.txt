Dividing a DataArray and putting names to each Matlab
<p>I have a data array with dimensions 1 x 95125. I want to extract data from it and then give each a name. For example </p> <pre><code>Station00001=[R{:,1:13}] Station00002=[R{:,15:27}] ..... Station06518 </code></pre> <p>The question is, is it possible to create a vector with all the wanted names and then open each data from the data array as above but with all the files with a for loop to its corresponding file This is what I did but its not working</p> <pre><code>for i= 1:(length(R)/14) k=0:((length(R)/14)-1) A(i)=1+14.*k; B(i)=A+12; Stations (i)= [R{:,A(i):B(i)}]; end </code></pre>
<p>Your loop is fine; not sure why you would want to store the A and B indices in an array, though.</p> <pre><code>numStations = floor(length(R)/14); %# careful: the number of columns in R is not a multiple of 14 Stations = cell(1,numStations); for i= 1:numStations fromColumn = (i-1)*14+1; toColumn = i*14-1; Stations{i}= [R{:,fromColumn:toColumn}]; end </code></pre> <p>To access the data from Station 25, use <code>Stations{25}</code></p>
