Matlab : Intersect point of curves
<p>Say for example I have data which forms the parabolic curve y=x^2, and I want to read off the x value for a given y value. How do I go about doing this in MATLAB?</p> <p>If it were a straight line, I could just use the equation of the line of best fit to calculate easily, however I can't do this with a curved line. If I can't find a solution, I'll solve for roots</p> <p>Thanks in advance.</p>
<p>Assuming your two curves are just two vectors of data, I would suggest you use <a href="http://www.mathworks.com/matlabcentral/fileexchange/11837-fast-and-robust-curve-intersections" rel="nofollow">Fast and Robust Curve Intersections</a> from the File Exchange.

<p>If all data are arrays (not analytical expressions), I usually do that finding minimal absolute error</p> <pre><code>x=some_array; [~,ind]=min(abs(x.^2-y0)) </code></pre> <p>Here <code>y0</code> is a given y value</p> <p>If your data are represented by a function, you can use <code>fsolve</code>:</p> <pre><code>function y = myfun(x) y=x^2-y0 [x,fval] = fsolve(@myfun,x0,options) </code></pre> <p>For symbolic computations, one can use <code>solve</code></p> <pre><code>syms x solve(x^2 - y0) </code></pre>
