Matlab: Calculating Correlation of time series
<p>The time series model is expressed as </p> <pre><code>y(t) = 0.5 + 0.3y(t-1) + n(t) </code></pre> <p>where </p> <pre><code>n(t) = 0.1*randn(500,1) for t=1,2,...,500 </code></pre> <p><a href="http://www.uio.no/studier/emner/matnat/ifi/INF4480/v10/undervisningsmateriale/spII_stocastic_processesIII_handout.pdf" rel="nofollow">Slides</a> contain the Correlation and covariance matrix. The formula for correlation is: <code>E[y(t)*y(t)^T]</code> which can be invoked by using <code>xcorr</code>. I would like to know how one can calculate the individual Correlation matrix for its lagged version <code>E[y(t-1)*y(t-1)^T]</code> without using the inbuilt commands so that I can finally implement the following expression</p> <pre><code> trace([E[y(t-1)*y(t-1)']]^-1) </code></pre> <p>UPDATE</p> <p>For example, Let </p> <pre><code>y = randn(10,1); for t = 1:10 disp(y(t)); end Expectation_y = sum(y(1:end))/10 </code></pre> <p>Likewise, how do I perform expectation for lagged variables and then implement the formula =</p> <pre><code> trace([E[y(t-1)*y(t-1)']]^-1) </code></pre>
<p>I'm not sure that I understand all of the details of your question, but if you just want to operate on a delayed version of a signal, you can do something like this...</p> <pre><code>%xcorr with a 1-sample shifted version of itself [c,lags]=xcorr(t(1:end-1),t(2:end)); %xcorr with a 2-sample shifted version of itself [c,lags]=xcorr(t(1:end-2),t(3:end)); %etc </code></pre> <p>If xcorr is not the operation that you want, you can do whatever operations you'd like with this indexing method of creating a time-shifted version of your signal.</p>
