Mapping Depth onto RGB Kinect using MATLAB
<p>I am trying to map the Depth map onto the RGB image on the Kinec using MATLAB. So here are the steps that I took: (1) Obtain the images using a C++ program. (2) Using the depth value from each pixel on MATLAB, I was able to obtain the XYZ distances of all the pixels in mm. (3) Then using some equations, I was able to obtain the XY pixel coordinates of those depth pixels on the RGB image.</p> <p>So I am left with a huge cell containing all the locations of the depth map w.r.t the color image.</p> <p>So my question is now if I want to overlay the depth image on the color image, how can I do that?</p> <p>Can anyone help me? </p> <p>Thanks;</p>
