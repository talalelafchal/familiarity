Plot lines where my data is constant
<p>I'm working on a fluid mechanics project and I'm not an expert on Matlab plots. I would like you to help me do the following thing (I'm not really sure what plotting function I have to use and how). You don't need to know any fluid mechanics to answer this question but I will explain you a little bit for a better understanding.</p> <p>I have an array of data, that represents the value of the stream function (psi) of a fluid inside a duct. Every node is a point in the duct. We know that if we draw a line that goes on a specific (constant) value of psi, there is an streamline. I want to plot these streamlines, without using the function <code>streamline</code> , just with a normal plot and using my data.</p> <p>My matrix is:</p> <pre><code>data = ( 10 10 10 10 10 10 10 10 10 10 10 10 10 10 10 10 ; 8.00 8.02 8.04 8.07 8.12 8.20 8.30 8.42 8.53 8.63 8.72 8.80 8.86 8.91 8.96 9.00; 6.00 6.03 6.07 6.12 6.22 6.37 6.59 6.83 7.07 7.28 7.45 7.60 7.72 7.83 7.92 8.00; 4.00 4.03 4.07 4.14 4.26 4.48 4.85 5.26 5.63 5.95 6.21 6.43 6.61 6.75 6.88 7.00; 2.00 2.02 2.05 2.10 2.20 2.44 3.08 3.70 4.23 4.67 5.01 5.29 5.52 5.70 5.86 6.00; 0 0 0 0 0 0 1.33 2.24 2.93 3.47 3.88 4.21 4.46 4.67 4.84 5.00; 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1.01 1.78 2.38 2.84 3.19 3.46 3.67 3.84 4.00; 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0.80 1.43 1.91 2.25 2.51 2.70 2.86 3.00; 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0.63 1.10 1.41 1.62 1.77 1.89 2.00; 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0.44 0.66 0.79 0.88 0.94 1.00; 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0) </code></pre> <p>Where there are zeros is because there is the wall. </p> <p>What I want to do, is plot the streamlines when: psi = 10, psi = 8, psi = 6, psi = 4, psi = 2.</p> <p>For example, the first streamline (psi=10) would be a straight line that would go horizontally where it has a value of 10. The second would be a little bit curved (because it has to follow everypoint where it has a value of 8. And so on.</p> <p>Could you guys help me with the code? I'm a bit messed with plots on Matlab. Thank you on beforehand.</p> <p>P.S: To get an idea this is the kind of plot (using my data, should be almost the same)! <a href="http://i58.tinypic.com/a4sosz.png" rel="nofollow">http://i58.tinypic.com/a4sosz.png</a></p>
<p>Something like this works for you? </p> <p>The <code>2:2:10</code> sets the level wanted to show. If you want to see better the 10 valued level youcan play a bit with the <code>axis</code> function</p> <pre><code>subplot(121) contour(data,2:2:10,'ShowText','on') subplot(122) contourf(data,2:2:10,'ShowText','on') </code></pre> <p><img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/U4ZSa.png" alt="enter image description here"></p> <p>If you want the plot upside down you can do <code>contour(flipud(data))</code></p>
