How do I reiterate a set of equations in Matlab until convergence?
<p>I have three equations, where u is previously defined as an mx1 vector and A is an mxn matrix:</p> <pre><code>v = A'*u/norm(A'*u); s = norm(A*v); u = A*v/norm(A*v); </code></pre> <p>I'm trying to reiterate these equations until they converge. I've been trying to use the solve() function:</p> <pre><code>[v s u] = solve(v == A'*u/norm(A'*u), s == norm(A*v), u == A*v/norm(A*v), v, s, u) </code></pre> <p>But I keep getting a whole bunch of errors when using that. How else could I do this?</p>
<p>Not sure what you were expecting using <code>solve</code>, but you can do this numerically using a <code>while</code> loop until the change in <code>v</code> and <code>u</code> is smaller than some tolerance.</p> <pre><code>A=rand(5,4); %// sample data u=rand(5,1); u2=u+1;v2=1;v=0; %// to make sure we enter the loop tol=1e-11 %// tolerance on change in u or v, to exit loop while(norm(u2-u)&gt;tol &amp;&amp; norm(v2-v)&gt;tol) %// continue until both changes are small enough u2 = u; v2 = v; v = A'*u/norm(A'*u) %// calculate new value of v s = norm(A*v); u = A*v/norm(A*v) %// new value of u end </code></pre>
