Find the new position of rectangle for resized image
<p>I have a four element position vector <code>[xmin ymin width hight]</code> that specifies the size and position of crop rectangle from image I. How can i find the new position and size for the resized image <code>I</code>?</p>
<p>It is not entirely clear, what you want, as we don't know your coordinate system. Assuming x is the horizontal axis and y is the vertical axis and your point (1,1) is at the top left corner, you can use the following snippet:</p> <pre><code>p = [xmin ymin width height]; I = I_orig(p(2):p(2)+p(4)-1,p(1):p(1)+p(3)-1); </code></pre> <p>The size is of course your specified width and height.</p>
<p>You can convert your original bounding box to relative values (that is assuming the image size is 1x1)</p> <pre><code> [origH origW] = size( origI(:,:,1) ); relativeBB = [xmin / origW, ymin / origH, width / origW, hight / origH]; </code></pre> <p>Now, no matter how you resized your <code>origI</code>, you can recover the bounding box w.r.t the new size from the relative representation:</p> <pre><code> [currH currW] = size(I(:,:,1)); currBB = relativeBB .* [currW, currH, currW, currH]; </code></pre> <p>You might need to <code>round</code> things a bit: you might find <code>floor</code> better for <code>xmin</code> and <code>ymin</code> and <code>ceil</code> more suitable for <code>width</code> and <code>height</code>. </p>
