Histogram from Spherical Plots in Matlab
<p>I have a data in azimuth and elevation angles with radius 1, e.g., <code>point = [azimuth, elevation, radius]</code>. I would like to divide the sphere surface into 64 regions and get a histogram of the points. For example, in the image below, there are 12 points in the first bin (<code>0 deg &lt;= azimuth &lt; 45 deg</code>,<code>0 deg &lt;= elevation &lt; 45 deg</code>) </p> <p><img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/ns0LL.jpg" alt="enter image description here"></p> <p>I am thinking of using Switch/Case to group the points but that would definitely be very inefficient. Is there any better way? </p> <p>Edited: I would like to find a way to label the regions (any way will do) and get a histogram, e.g <code>myHist = [... 1 1 ... 10 3 ... ]</code> <img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/91XU5.jpg" alt="enter image description here"></p>
<p>I'm not completely sure about it, test it with your data, see how it goes,</p> <pre><code>r = ones(1,100); a = 2*pi*rand(1,100); e = 2*pi*rand(1,100); [X,Y,Z] = sphere(8) ; [x y z] = sph2cart(a,e,r); surf(X,Y,Z);hold on; plot3(x,y,z,'ko','MarkerFaceColor','k'); axis([-1 1 -1 1 -1 1]); fields = linspace(0,2*pi,9); c = {fields,fields}; Hist = hist3(cat(2,a',e'),'Edges',c); Hist(:,end) = []; Hist(end,:) = []; </code></pre> <p><img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/xSk1x.png" alt="enter image description here"></p> <pre><code> Hist = 2 1 0 2 2 2 1 0 0 0 2 1 2 2 3 2 1 2 3 2 0 4 4 2 1 0 0 1 1 2 1 4 0 3 1 1 4 1 3 1 3 3 1 3 4 1 1 0 1 5 2 1 0 0 2 0 0 0 3 1 1 0 2 2 sum(sum(Hist)) = 100; </code></pre> <p>I think it could be better if you use <code>bar3</code></p> <p><img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/bEWU1.png" alt="enter image description here"></p>
