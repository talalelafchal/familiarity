Using filename to assign variables in matlab
<p>This may be a simple question, but a matlab noob here and I can't find something similar in searching. </p> <p>I have a bunch of filenames like this that I'm looping through: goes12.2009.242.201515.BAND_01.nc</p> <p>I want to assign the 8-11th character (ie 2009) as the year, the 13-15th (ie 242) as the day, the 17-18th (ie 20) as the hour, the 19-20th (ie 15) as the min and the 21-22 (ie 15) as the second.</p> <p>I believe this can be done somewhat simply? Thanks so much in advance for any insight!!</p>
<p>sure, it can be done u just need to transform the string (character) into number</p> <pre><code>filename=goes12.2009.242.201515.BAND_01.nc; yr=str2double(filename(8:11)); doy=str2double(filename(13:15)); hr=str2double(filename(17:18)); min=str2double(filename(19:20)); sec=str2double(filename(21:22)); </code></pre> <p>and good luck with nc data</p>
