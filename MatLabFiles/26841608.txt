Standalone Matlab program
<p>I have heard that it is possible to make standalone programs using Matlab compiler. It is good but I doubt that if someone can use the commands in the tool boxes and make a standalone program out of them otherwise one could make a program using optimization tool box and distribute it, then no body would pay for such a too box. Am I right? Is it possible to use the features available in tool boxes to make a standalone program in Matlab?</p>
<p>There are certain features in toolboxes which are not supported by MATLAB Compiler. These mainly include GUIs provided with the toolboxes, such as <code>imtool</code>, <code>cftool</code>, <code>systemIdentification</code>, <code>pidTuner</code>, etc... and things the Compiler itself, or code-generation tools such as MATLAB Coder. For an exhaustive list, see <a href="http://www.mathworks.co.uk/products/compiler/supported/compiler_support.html" rel="nofollow">Support for MATLAB and Toolboxes</a> on the MathWorks web site.</p> <p>Note that for the end user to run the compiled MATLAB application, he first needs to install the MCR (MATLAB Component Runtime) on his machine. This is essentially a "headless" version of MATLAB which can only be called by the compiled application, and is freely distributable to end users by the person who has a license for MATLAB Compiler.</p>
