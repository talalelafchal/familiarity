How to work with a simulink model without matlab?
<p>A friend of mine (working in a University) is developing a model in Simulink. I (not affiliated with said University) would like to play around and experiment with the model programmatically. i.e. running experiments, different input permutations ... etc. </p> <p>Is it possible for my friend to export the simulink model and send it to me, so that I can work on it without having either Matlab or Simulink installed on my computer?</p>
<p>There isn't an easy solution. Your friend can use <a href="http://uk.mathworks.com/products/simulink-coder/" rel="nofollow">Simulink Coder</a> to generate C code from the Simulink model, or even an executable, and then you can run that C code or executable.</p> <p>With a bit more work, he can create a MATLAB GUI as a user interface to the generated C code or the executable (<strong>not the model</strong>), and then package the whole thing (GUI + generated C code) with <a href="http://uk.mathworks.com/products/compiler/" rel="nofollow">MATLAB Compiler</a>. It's more user-friendly for the end-user (i.e. you) but it's by no means not easy to do.</p> <p>See <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/22516506/deployment-of-simulink-models">Deployment of Simulink Models</a> and <a href="http://uk.mathworks.com/matlabcentral/answers/102874-how-do-i-deploy-a-simulink-model-over-the-web-using-matlab-compiler-4-5-r2006b" rel="nofollow">How do I deploy a Simulink model over the web using MATLAB Compiler 4.5 (R2006b)?</a> for similar/related questions.</p>
