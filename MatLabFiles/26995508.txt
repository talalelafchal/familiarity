using autocorr for different matlab versions
<p>I'm trying to compute the autocorrelation of my timeseries. This work on my laptop with matlab R2011a, but not on my desktop with matlab R2013a. I read somewhere that the Signal Processing Toolbox needs to be installed, and that is the case on both of my computers. There seems to be no function at all called autocorr, but I can find it again on the matworks documentation for 2014b. I have the same problem with xcorr, although matlab seems to recognize the function ('help xcorr' works, 'help autocorr' not). How can I fix this?</p>
