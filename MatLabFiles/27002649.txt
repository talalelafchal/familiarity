How to detect similar bass line in two songs?
<p>I have two songs that have similar bass lines.</p> <p>How can I detect it programmatically?</p> <p>What audio features best suited for this? What libs can be used in Matlab?</p> <p>You can listen and download them here <a href="http://rghost.ru/59138744" rel="nofollow">1</a>,<a href="http://rghost.ru/59138767" rel="nofollow">2</a></p> <p>I tried this <a href="http://labrosa.ee.columbia.edu/matlab/fingerprint/" rel="nofollow">code from Labrosa</a>, but it not suitable for this task, it's just for finding duplicates not for finding similar songs. Also I found this question <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/20644599/similarity-between-two-signals-looking-for-simple-measure">Similarity between two signals: looking for simple measure</a> seems this about Time-Frequency Analysis. and also <a href="http://www.mathworks.com/help/signal/examples/measuring-signal-similarities.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.mathworks.com/help/signal/examples/measuring-signal-similarities.html</a></p> <p>In more general I interested in any audio features that can help predict song "similarity".</p> <p>In more narrow sence such features must be near identical for example for same song from studio and live concert.</p>
