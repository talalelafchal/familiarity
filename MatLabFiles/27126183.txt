subindex into a cell array of strings
<p>I have a 6 x 3 cell (called strat) where the first two columns contain text, the last column has either 1 or 2.</p> <p>I want to take a subset of this cell array. Basically select only the rows where the last column has a 1 in it.</p> <p>I tried the following,</p> <pre><code>ff = strat(strat(:, 3), 1:2) == 1; </code></pre> <p>The error message is,</p> <pre><code>Function 'subsindex' is not defined for values of class 'cell'. </code></pre> <p>How can I index into a cell array?</p>
<p>Cell arrays are accessed through braces <code>{}</code> instead of parentheses <code>()</code>. Then, as a 2nd subtlety, when pulling values out of a cell arrays, you need to gather them...for numerics you gather them into regular arrays using <code>[]</code> and for strings you gather them into a new cell array using <code>{}</code>. Confusing, eh? </p> <pre><code>ff = { strat{ [strat{:,3}]==1 , 1:2 } }; </code></pre> <p>Gathering into cell arrays this way can often give the wrong shape when you're done. So, you might try something like this</p> <pre><code>ind = find([strat{:,3}]==1); %find the relevant indices ff = {{strat{ind,1}; strat{ind,2}}'; %this will probably give you the right shape </code></pre>
