Plotting a Line from a known point to points in a fitted curve in MATLAB
<p>I have a set of data whose points I have plotted and fitted using a power of 2 fit in MATLAB. I'm trying to draw 3 lines to that curve as tangential lines. Each of these lines start from the co-ordinates of say, (x,y): (2,0) (4,0) (9,0).</p> <p>Is it possible for MATLAB to draw lines from the curve to the first known point until the line has only one solution (tangent to the curve) with the curve? </p> <p>I feel that this requires some sort of specified interval which tells MATLAB to step the co-ordinates until it finds the closest point. Does anyone know if this has been done or can be done at all?</p>
<p>From a point not lying on the curve, you want to draw a line that is tangent to it. In case of a convex function like y=2^x this is only possible from a point under the curve (not over it). </p> <p>Since you already have the point (call it (a,b)), you need the slope of such a line. The slope is determined by the values (y-b)/(x-a) where (x,y) runs over the curve. Specifically, the "forward-looking" tangent has the slope equal to the minimum of (y-b)/(x-a) over all x>a. And the "backward-looking " tangent has the slope equal to the maximum of (y-b)/(x-a) over all x <p>Here is a very straightforward implementation of the above: I used <code>find</code> to restrict the search to either x>a or x&lt;a and took <code>min</code> and <code>max</code> to find the slopes. </p> <pre><code>x = 0:0.01:4; y = 2.^x; a = 2; b = 3; k = min((y(find(x&gt;a))-b)./(x(find(x&gt;a))-a)); plot(x,y) hold on plot(x,k*(x-a)+b,'r') k = max((y(find(x&lt;a))-b)./(x(find(x&lt;a))-a)); plot(x,k*(x-a)+b,'g') </code></pre> <p><img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/KdDzk.png" alt="tangents"></p>
