How can I find camera pose from matlab calibration?
<p>As far as I know the Caltech Matlab toolbox gives the internal camera parameters (focal length, principle point,...) and camera matrix.</p> <p>As external camera parameters it gives the transformation matrices for each image used in the calibration (chessboard pattern).</p> <p>My question is how can I find the pose of the camera given the internal and external parameters from Caltech matlab calibration toolbox?</p>
<p>Pose relative to what? The extrinsic parameters give you the pose of the camera relative to the checkerboard in each of the calibration images. Pose here is represented as a translation and a rotation from the checkerboard's coordinate system into the camera's coordinate system.</p> <p>By the way, there is now <a href="http://www.mathworks.com/videos/camera-calibration-with-matlab-81233.html" rel="nofollow">support for camera calibration in the Computer Vision System Toolbox</a>. There is also a function called <code>extrinsics</code>, which computes the pose of a calibrated camera (in terms of translation and rotation) relative to a world coordinate system (e. g. represented by checkerboard points).</p>
