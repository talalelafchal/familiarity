Sensor size of webcam
<p>Using the calibration methods (Matlab or OpenCV), one can find the focal length of a webcam. I am wondering if there is anyway to measure the sensor size of a webcam as well?</p> <p>Thanks</p>
<p>it is <code>pixel size * resolution</code></p> <p>resolution is nothing but image <code>width * height</code> in pixels</p> <p>in general pixel size is written at the specs of the camera; if you dont know, then <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pinhole_camera_model" rel="nofollow">pinhole camera model</a></p> <pre><code>f / (distance to object in mm) = (object length in pixels) * (pixel size in mm) / (object length in mm) </code></pre> <p>may help you calculate that. you should use an object with known size and at a precise distance to use the formula.</p>
