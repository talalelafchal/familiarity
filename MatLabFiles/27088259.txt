Simulink Scope data not accessible after running the sim() command
<p>I am running a <a href="http://www.mathworks.com/help/simulink/" rel="nofollow">Simulink </a> model from the command line using the <a href="http://www.mathworks.com/help/simulink/ug/using-the-sim-command.html" rel="nofollow">sim()</a> command. I also activated the <a href="http://www.mathworks.com/help/rtwin/ug/logging-signals-to-the-base-workspace.html" rel="nofollow">Save data to workspace</a> in my scopes. The simulation runs without problems but the variables are not saved by the scope. Note that if I start the simulation using the play button from my simulink model, data is saved to the workspace. </p>
<p>The comment from @am304 gave me a start point. One has to use </p> <pre><code>SimOut = sim(my_model); x=SimOut.get('VariableName') </code></pre> <p>and problem solved</p>
