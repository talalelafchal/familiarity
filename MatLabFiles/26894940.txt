extracting an output matrix from matlab
<p>I am working on a small iris recognition system using matlab, my matlab code after several steps and algorithms gives me a 9600 bit matrix as an output, and I was wondering how can I take this matrix to process it using a Windows Forms application using C#? </p>
<p>There are some standard formats that you can work with them both in MATLAB and C#. </p> <p>For example, you can use <code>csvwrite</code> function in MATLAB to save it as a comma-separated value file. The in C# there are standard ways to read a csv file. <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/5282999/reading-csv-file-and-storing-values-into-an-array">Here</a> it is discussed how to read a CSV file in C#.</p> <p>Another option is to save in a .txt file and read it in C#. HDF5 files are another type that are supported with some libraries in both (see <a href="http://www.mathworks.com/help/matlab/hdf5-files.html" rel="nofollow">here</a>). You can even save your file as a regular .mat file and load it in C# using a specific API (discussed <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/4281348/import-read-load-variables-from-matlab-matfile-in-c-sharp">here</a>) </p>
