How to add folders to path, when running matlab from sublime text
<p>I just configured my sublime text 3 for matlab a few days ago. The build is fine, and I can run a matlab file in sublime successfully. </p> <p>But I had a problem when I tried to run a matlab file that calls a function in another folder. I know clearly that in matlab, in such cases, I need to add that folder to the path, and I know how to do it in matlab. But I didn't figure out how to "add folder to path" in sublime. </p> <p>Does anyone have the same problem? Thanks!</p> <p>(I tried to search a solution on web, but it seems that no one ask similar problems).</p>
