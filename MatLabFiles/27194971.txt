title and legend not appearing in matlab?
<p>I've consulted the "Getting Started Guide" for MATLAB 7, and I was certain my code for this assignment was correct, but when I run it the legend and title do not display.</p> <p>My code is:</p> <pre><code>x= [-1:0.1:1]; a=sin(x); b=cos(x); c=tan(x); plot (x,a, 'r-',x,b, 'k:',x,c, 'bo') legend (sin(x),cos(x), tan(x)) title ('Trig Functions') </code></pre> <p>What have I done wrong?</p>
<p>You need to enclose the text you want to put in the legend in ' ' (damn I forgot the name of these sorry) otherwise MATLAB throws an error since it expects strings as arguments:</p> <pre><code>legend ('sin(x)','cos(x)', 'tan(x)','Location','best') </code></pre> <p>Doing so will remove the error and display the title correctly, which you have put between ' '. Note that I used the <code>Location</code> property to put the legend in the best possible way since it was hiding part of the plots. You can put it wherever you want with other values; look <a href="http://www.mathworks.com/help/matlab/ref/legend.html?searchHighlight=legend" rel="nofollow">here</a> for details.</p>
