Multiscale search for HOG+SVM in Matlab
<p>first of all this is my first question here, so I hope I can explain it in a clear way.</p> <p>My goal is to detect different classes of traffic signs in images. For that purpose I have trained binary SVMs following these steps:</p> <ul> <li>First I got a database of cropped traffic signs like the one in the link. I considered different classes (prohibition, danger, etc), and negative images. All of them were scaled to 40x40 pixels. </li> </ul> <p><a href="http://i.imgur.com/Hm9YyZT.jpg" rel="nofollow">http://i.imgur.com/Hm9YyZT.jpg</a></p> <ul> <li>I trained linear-SVM models for each class (1-vs-all), using HOG as feature. Each image is described with a 1728-dimensional feature. (I append the three feature vectors for all three image planes). I did crossvalidation to set parameter C, and tested on previously unseen 40x40 images, and I got very accurate results (F1 score over 0.9 for all classes). I used libsvm for training and testing.</li> </ul> <p>Now I'd want to detect signs in full road images, sliding a window in different image scales. The problem I'm facing is that I couldn't find any function that can do it for me (as DetectMultiScale in OpenCV), and my solution is very slow and rudimentary (I'm just doing a triple for loop, and for each scale I crop consecutive and overlapping 40x40 images, obtain HOG features and apply <em>svmpredict</em> for each one).</p> <p>Can someone give me a clue to find a faster way to do it? I thought too about getting the HOG feature vector of the whole input image, and then reorder that vector to a matrix where each row will have the features corresponding to each 40x40 window, but I couldn't find a straightforward way of doing it. </p> <p>Thanks,</p>
<p>I would suggest using SURF feature detection, however I don't know if this would also be too slow your needs.</p> <p>See : <a href="http://morf.lv/modules.php?name=tutorials&amp;lasit=2" rel="nofollow">http://morf.lv/modules.php?name=tutorials&amp;lasit=2</a> for more information on how to implement and weather it is a viable solution for you.</p>
