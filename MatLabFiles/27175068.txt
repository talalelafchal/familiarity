how to read this matlab for loop with % operator
<p>here is a portion of matlab code I'm to translate in another language</p> <pre><code>for a=10%[7 10 12],%20 50 200] for b=20% 25 30],%50], for c=1 %1.25 1.5],% 2] </code></pre> <p>I'm not really a matlab user, and dont understand these lines. I imagine the right sides of assignments define lists of values to iterate on, but don't understand the meaning of the % and the [], and why are there more ']' than '[' and why there is a ',' at the end of second line?</p>
<p>In MATLAB <code>for</code> loops are like this</p> <pre><code>for i = [0 1 5 2] statements end </code></pre> <p>or </p> <pre><code>for i = 1 : 1 : 10 % i iterates over integers from `1` to `10` statement end </code></pre> <p>And the <code>%</code> is used for comments,</p> <pre><code>% MATLAB comment line </code></pre> <p>So simplified form of your code is:</p> <pre><code>for a = 10 for b = 20 for c = 1 </code></pre> <p>which is like </p> <pre><code> a = 10 b = 20 c = 1 </code></pre>
