How to plot an cylindrical coordinates equation in cartesian
<p>I have this equation <code>r=z*cos(theta)</code> and I need to plot it in Cartesian coordinates in Matlab. How can I do this?</p>
<p>First off, the definition of your cylindrical co-ordinates is wrong. Given the azimuthal sweep around the <code>z</code> axis <code>theta</code> as well as the radius of the cylinder <code>r</code>, the Cartesian co-ordinates within a cylinder is defined as:</p> <pre><code>x = r*cos(theta) y = r*sin(theta) z = z </code></pre> <p>Therefore, you would need to define a grid of co-ordinates for <code>r</code>, <code>theta</code> and <code>z</code>, use these co-ordinates and plug them into the above code, then draw them. I would recommend you use <a href="http://www.mathworks.com/help/matlab/ref/plot3.html" rel="nofollow noreferrer"><code>plot3</code></a> as you want to plot 3D points in Cartesian space. Also, use <a href="http://www.mathworks.com/help/matlab/ref/meshgrid.html" rel="nofollow noreferrer"><code>meshgrid</code></a> to define your grid of points. </p> <p>As such, the radius of a cylinder is (usually) constant when you're drawing it, and <code>theta</code> and <code>z</code> are the quantities you are varying. Let's assume that <code>-2 &lt;= z &lt;= 2</code> and <code>r = 2</code>. We know that to create a cylinder, we have to sweep around a circle from <code>0 &lt;= theta &lt;= 2*pi</code>. Therefore, do something like this:</p> <pre><code>%// Define (r,theta,z) [theta, z] = meshgrid(0:0.001:2*pi, -2:0.001:2); r = 2*ones(size(theta)); %// Calculate x and y. z was calculated earlier x = r.*cos(theta); y = r.*sin(theta); %// Plot the points plot3(x(:), y(:), z(:), 'b.'); grid; view(-48,60); %// Adjust viewing angle </code></pre> <hr> <p>This is what I get:</p> <p><img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/ZiPsP.png" alt="enter image description here"></p> <hr> <p>You can certainly use more efficient techniques, like what Kamtal has suggested with <code>pol2cart</code>, but you said you wanted the actual Cartesian co-ordinates, and so <code>x</code>, <code>y</code> and <code>z</code> contains those co-ordinates in 3D space for you. I'm assuming you want these for further processing.</p> <p>Good luck!</p>
<pre><code>n = linspace(-pi,pi,20); m = linspace(0,1,20); [theta,z] = meshgrid(n,m); r = z .* cos(theta); [X,Y,Z] = pol2cart(theta,r,z); surf(X,Y,Z) axis equal </code></pre> <p><img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/BYv7h.png" alt="enter image description here"></p> <p>If you change it to <code>r = 1 .* cos(theta);</code> then you will get a cylinder,</p> <p><img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/ycAuP.png" alt="enter image description here"></p>
