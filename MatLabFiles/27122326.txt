Exporting a figure
<p>I came across <a href="http://www.mathworks.com/matlabcentral/fileexchange/23629-export-fig" rel="nofollow">this</a> program for exporting a figure. I just want to ask, what should I pass to the program if I want to export a figure of mine to some image (i.e; .jpg), as I couldn't figure out what to pass as a parameter.</p> <p>Thanks.</p>
<p>patrik's suggestion probably refers to <a href="http://www.mathworks.com/matlabcentral/fileexchange/23629-export-fig" rel="nofollow">this ME file</a>. (Which is great, by the way)</p> <p>A native MATLAB solution would be</p> <pre><code>saveas(&lt;handle of the figure&gt;,&lt;file path with .jpg at the end&gt;) </code></pre> <p>This is what I have used for a long time and it works (e.g., <code>saveas(h,'/figures/automatic/myfig.jpg')</code>); but it is very possible that <code>print</code> or something else is better suited for whatever reason.</p>
<p>The built-in command <a href="http://se.mathworks.com/help/matlab/ref/print.html" rel="nofollow"><code>print</code></a> is used to export a figure to an image. Like so:</p> <pre><code> plot(rand(4)) print('-djpeg', 'myplot.jpg') </code></pre>
