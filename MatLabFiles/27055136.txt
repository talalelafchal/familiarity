Matlab changing to function
<p>So basically I know the coding but I don't understand why it doesn't run. I have begun studying function and I am trying to run this code example out the book but it doesn't allow me when I paste it unto MATLAB just like this, I don't know why. I looked through the MATLAB website but their examples are quite hard to follow, maybe I just don't see it. </p> <pre><code>function Exercise5_20 tto = fzero(@Tto, [0.2 0.9]) function t = Tto(x) t = Thq(exp(-x*pi^2))-pi/2/sqrt(5); function qq = Thq(q) k = 0:10; qq = 2*q^(1/4).*sum((-1).^k./(2*k+1).*q.^(k.*(k+1))); </code></pre>
