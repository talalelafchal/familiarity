function that outputs all combinations by selecting one member from each vector MATLAB
<p>Does anybody know how to take one member of each of the three vectors and write all possible combinations of each of the three like this:</p> <pre><code>A=[1,2,3];B=[4,5,6];C=[7,8]; Funcion(A,B,C) 1 4 7 1 4 8 1 5 7 1 5 8 ... 3 6 8 </code></pre> <p>i would like it to be outputted into a matrix if possible</p> <p>sorry im new to matlab </p> <p>Thanks in advance</p>
<p>Yes <code>allcomb</code> could be used while your matlab may not have this function. Then check out here <a href="http://www.mathworks.com/matlabcentral/fileexchange/10064-allcomb/content/allcomb.m" rel="nofollow">here</a>. You could also customize your own function after taking a look at the link</p>
<p>If you have the Neural Network Toolbox, the <a href="http://www.mathworks.com/help/nnet/ref/combvec.html?refresh=true" rel="nofollow"><code>combvec</code></a> function will do what you need.</p> <pre><code>ABC = combvec(A,B,C)' ABC = 1 4 7 2 4 7 3 4 7 1 5 7 2 5 7 3 5 7 1 6 7 2 6 7 3 6 7 1 4 8 2 4 8 3 4 8 1 5 8 2 5 8 3 5 8 1 6 8 2 6 8 3 6 8 </code></pre>
