How to use convolution in Matlab
<p>My problem is find the output to <code>U(t+1)-U(t-1)</code> with Matlab given the transfer function <code>H(s)</code>.</p> <p>I know that I should be able to find the output to any input of an LTI system when given <code>H(s)</code>, so I tried using convolution to find the output and plot it. Below is my attempt at using the <code>conv</code> to produce the output. <code>Ht= dirac(t) - 4*exp(-6*t)</code></p> <pre><code>syms s t b Hs=(s+2)/(s+6) Ht=ilaplace(Hs) tt=0:.1:60 Hnum= subs(Ht, 't',[eps:.1:10]); %turn symbolic vector into actual A=double(Hnum); input=ones(1, 501); output=conv(input,A) figure(3) plot(tt,output) </code></pre> <p>I also tried to use the integral way</p> <pre><code> %b is tau t1=0; t2=int(exp(-(6*b)),b,0,t+1)+1 t3=int(exp(-(6*b)),b,t-1,t+1) </code></pre> <p>I know that <code>H(t)*x(t) = y(t)</code>. I was not able to get any reasonable output for the graphs. Any hints or help are much appreciated. </p>
