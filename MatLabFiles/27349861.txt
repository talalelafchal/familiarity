MATLAB: evaluate a polynomial based on zeros and initial condition
<p>On MATLAB, it's possible to get the coefficients of a polynomial <code>p</code> based on its roots through</p> <pre><code>r = [5 6 18]; p = poly(r); </code></pre> <p>My problem requires that the coefficients of the polynomial satisfy f(0) = -2, however, and I don't know how to integrate this requirement into the command above. I have access to <code>polyval()</code> as well, but I'm not sure how that'd help.</p> <p>Thank you for your help!</p>
<p>For this specific case (where <code>f(0)</code> is not a root of the equation), you can simply do the following:</p> <pre><code>r=[5 6 18] p=poly(r) f0=-2 p=p*f0/polyval(p,0) %// just scaling p so that f(0)=-2 polyval(p,0) %// checking the answer </code></pre> <p>But in general, you can use <code>polyfit</code></p> <pre><code>p2=polyfit([0 r],[-2 0 0 0],3) %// f(0)=-2 and f(r)=0 for r=5,6,18 </code></pre>
