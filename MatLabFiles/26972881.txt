Create a 1-D array that shows the indexes of a 2-D array
<p>Lets say, we have the following two-dimensional array in Matlab:</p> <pre><code>A=[0 451 0 446 0 543 .....] </code></pre> <p>etc. I want to create another, one-dimensional array, that will do this: For example, lets call the 1-D array <code>B</code>, <code>B(1)</code> will "show" to <code>[0 451]</code>. B(2) will "show" to <code>[0 446]</code>, B(3) will "show" to <code>[0 543]</code> and so on.I hope that my desired result is pretty clear to anyone who could give me a bit help.</p>
<p>Well, what you have just set is impossible, you are mixing the arrays and the Dimensions. As you have explained it, B is 2-D, and A is 1-D. You can do what you want by doing this: </p> <pre><code>j=0; i=1; while i&lt;=size(A,2)/2; j=j+1; B(i,1)=A(j); j=j+1; B(i,2)=A(j); i=i+1; end </code></pre>
<p>Two ways:</p> <pre><code>a=1:10 split_a1=(reshape(a,2,[])).'; </code></pre> <p>Access <code>split_a1</code> as <code>split_a1(1,:),...,split_a1(5,:);</code>.</p> <pre><code>split_a2=mat2cell(a,1,2*ones(1,numel(a)/2)); </code></pre> <p>Access <code>split_a2</code> as <code>split_a2{1},...,split_a2{5};</code>.</p>
