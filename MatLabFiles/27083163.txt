Function which relies on workspace and memory
<p>I have a function which gets its inputs from a <code>.mat</code> file. This works just fine, but recently I had to update those variables and they increased by orders of magnitude in number. Therefore, the loading time increased. </p> <p>Since the function is iterated <code>10 000</code> times this is a major problem now. You may ask, why do you load those workspace variables in the first place? The answer to this is that I import variables that may change from time to time which I save conveniently as workspace before calling the function. The previous code had those variables written in the script similar to <code>a=1</code> <code>b=4</code> etc., which only works if the user accesses the code which I rather avoid. </p> <p>So the question is, how can I access those variables elegantly in a function? </p> <pre><code>function load vars.mat execute statements ... end </code></pre> <p>or</p> <pre><code>function global vars execute statements end </code></pre> <p>seem to be a much, much slower variant of </p> <pre><code>function a=1 b=4 ... execute statements end </code></pre>
