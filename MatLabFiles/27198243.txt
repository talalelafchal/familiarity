Deblurred images in Matlab by division process
<p>I am trying to deblur the images by dividing the blurred image in the frequency domain by specific filter also in the frequency domain ... the problem is the result of division is <code>NaN</code>! The image is also completely black. Can anyone explain what I'm doing wrong? My code is below:</p> <pre><code>G1 = imread('B1.jpg'); figure, imshow (G1); % FFT for B1 G_1 = fftshift(G1); G_1 = fft2(G_1); G_1 = ifftshift(G_1); figure, imshow( G_1); h_1 = fspecial( 'gaussian', [512 512] , 1.0 ); % Fourier Transform of 2D Gaussian H_1 = fftshift(h_1); H_1 = fft2(H_1); H_1 = ifftshift(H_1); figure, imshow (abs (H_1) ,[ ]); % Apply the filter for Image G_1 F_1a = G_1 ./ H_1; F_1a = ifftshift (F_1a); F_1a = ifft2 (F_1a); F_1a = fftshift (F_1a); figure, imshow (F_1a); </code></pre> <p>You can find the <code>B1</code> image below:</p> <p><img src="https://i.imgur.com/Bkon0PX.jpg" alt=""></p>
<p>In general, you can get a NaN anytime both your numerator and denominator are both zero. Furthermore, anytime your denominator is zero, you'll get an Inf. Either is bad. So, after your <code>G_1./H_1</code> operation, I'd check for NaN and Inf and replace by zero.</p>
