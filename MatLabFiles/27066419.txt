Plot this kind of graph from data of an array
<p>Good afternoon,</p> <p>I am working on a Matlab project and I have stored some data in an array. I would like to plot a plot like the plot shown below. However, I don't know what <strong>plotting function</strong> I need to use and <strong>how</strong>, in order to obtain the image plot (it will be not the same, but this style).</p> <p>My data is on a 11x16 - matrix.</p> <p>Thank you guys so much beforehand!</p> <p><img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/1IDN9.png" alt="enter image description here"></p> <hr> <p>@rayryeng</p> <p>It was a really useful answer, although I didn't need that exact shape. I need the shape that my data would create, I've been trying to modify the code you wrote in order to obtain what I need but I did not obtained it...</p> <p>My data is</p> <pre><code>data = ( 10 10 10 10 10 10 10 10 10 10 10 10 10 10 10 10 ; 8.00 8.02 8.04 8.07 8.12 8.20 8.30 8.42 8.53 8.63 8.72 8.80 8.86 8.91 8.96 9.00; 6.00 6.03 6.07 6.12 6.22 6.37 6.59 6.83 7.07 7.28 7.45 7.60 7.72 7.83 7.92 8.00; 4.00 4.03 4.07 4.14 4.26 4.48 4.85 5.26 5.63 5.95 6.21 6.43 6.61 6.75 6.88 7.00; 2.00 2.02 2.05 2.10 2.20 2.44 3.08 3.70 4.23 4.67 5.01 5.29 5.52 5.70 5.86 6.00; 0 0 0 0 0 0 1.33 2.24 2.93 3.47 3.88 4.21 4.46 4.67 4.84 5.00; 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1.01 1.78 2.38 2.84 3.19 3.46 3.67 3.84 4.00; 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0.80 1.43 1.91 2.25 2.51 2.70 2.86 3.00; 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0.63 1.10 1.41 1.62 1.77 1.89 2.00; 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0.44 0.66 0.79 0.88 0.94 1.00; 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0) </code></pre> <p>This is my matrix of data (sorry I know it's too long), well and when I try to plot writing:</p> <pre><code>[x,y] = meshgrid(1:16,1:11); contourf(x,y,data,20,'LineStyle','none'); colorbar </code></pre> <p>It should have a different shape than what I get. <strong>I need to get that the part that are 0 (zeros) are like the white part of the plot I showed before. (Different shape though)</strong> I don't really know how to do it (my data should be read properly), if you could help me I would be really thankful.</p> <p>Thank you so much for last answer.</p>
<p>It depends on your data, I believe you should use <code>contourf</code>.</p> <p>This is as close as I could get,</p> <pre><code>[x,y] = meshgrid(1:16,1:11); data = - y; data(end,5:10) = NaN; data(end-1,6:9) = NaN; data(end-2,7:8) = NaN; contourf(x,y,data,20,'LineStyle','none'); colorbar </code></pre> <p><img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/vdM2V.png" alt="enter image description here"></p> <p>with,</p> <pre><code>data = - y .* abs(log(sin(.10 * x - 5.5)+.5)); data(data &lt; -4) = NaN; </code></pre> <p><img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/NMgCz.png" alt="enter image description here"></p> <p>So I suppose the code is right, it's matter of your data,</p> <p>with <code>data = max(data(:)) - data;</code></p> <p><img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/lhPWr.png" alt="enter image description here"></p>
<p>What you have is almost correct. All you need to do is set any data that is 0 to <code>NaN</code>. That way, when you throw it into <code>contourf</code>, those parts are not visualized. As such:</p> <pre><code>data = [10 10 10 10 10 10 10 10 10 10 10 10 10 10 10 10 ; 8.00 8.02 8.04 8.07 8.12 8.20 8.30 8.42 8.53 8.63 8.72 8.80 8.86 8.91 8.96 9.00; 6.00 6.03 6.07 6.12 6.22 6.37 6.59 6.83 7.07 7.28 7.45 7.60 7.72 7.83 7.92 8.00; 4.00 4.03 4.07 4.14 4.26 4.48 4.85 5.26 5.63 5.95 6.21 6.43 6.61 6.75 6.88 7.00; 2.00 2.02 2.05 2.10 2.20 2.44 3.08 3.70 4.23 4.67 5.01 5.29 5.52 5.70 5.86 6.00; 0 0 0 0 0 0 1.33 2.24 2.93 3.47 3.88 4.21 4.46 4.67 4.84 5.00; 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1.01 1.78 2.38 2.84 3.19 3.46 3.67 3.84 4.00; 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0.80 1.43 1.91 2.25 2.51 2.70 2.86 3.00; 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0.63 1.10 1.41 1.62 1.77 1.89 2.00; 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0.44 0.66 0.79 0.88 0.94 1.00; 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]; data(data == 0) = NaN; [x,y] = meshgrid(1:16,1:11); contourf(x,y,data,20,'LineStyle','none'); colorbar </code></pre> <hr> <p>This is what I get:</p> <p><img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/krbuF.png" alt="enter image description here"></p> <p>Given your comments, you want the y-axis to be reversed. Simply put <code>axis ij;</code> at the end of the code above to flip the <code>y</code>-axis so that <code>y</code>-down is the positive direction. If you do that, we get this figure:</p> <p><img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/M9lJX.png" alt="enter image description here"></p> <hr> <p>Credit should go to Kamtal as he figured out where you needed to start. I just helped finish off the requirement.</p>
