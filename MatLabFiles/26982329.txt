How to compose a 3d array from 3 1d arrays in MATLAB?
<p>My code is as follows:</p> <pre><code>a = [.325 81 14; .272 105 26; .310 130 35]; b = [.305 75 18; .250 91 23; .285 126 41]; c = [.315 88 15; .265 95 21; .297 113 31]; abc(:,:,1) = a; abc(:,:,2) = b; abc(:,:,3) = c; </code></pre> <p>Essentially, what I want to do is make <code>abc</code> a 3d array of <code>a</code>, <code>b</code> and <code>c</code> with <code>a</code> on the first page, <code>b</code> on the second page, and <code>c</code> on the third page. However, when I input this into the command window, I get the following error: </p> <blockquote> <p>Subscripted assignment dimension mismatch.</p> </blockquote> <p>What's wrong with what I'm doing? I read a lot of similar posts where what I wrote was suggested, but my code doesn't seem to work.</p>
<p>It's possible the variable <code>abc</code> already exists in your workspace, which would give you the error you're seeing. A better way of creating your 3D matrix is to use the <code>cat</code> command:</p> <pre><code>abc = cat(3,a,b,c); </code></pre> <p><code>cat</code> concatenates the specified variables along the specified dimension (in this case the 3rd dimension). </p>
