Matlab Running a parameterized fminsearch in a for loop?
<p>Essentially I want to have fminsearch run over a variety or parameters.</p> <p>So I have the following snipet of code running:</p> <pre><code>%Setting up the changeable WIRX parameters: L = 0.15; %Length along the electrodes in meters I = 3000; %Current in amps %Running the fminsearch: TeNe = fminsearch(@(params) TeNe(params,L,I),[5,1.5e21],optimset('MaxFunEvals', 100000,'MaxIter', 100000)); </code></pre> <p>What I want to do is be able to run this in a for loop with an array of values for L and I. However what i noticed is that I cannot even run this piece of code twice in a row with out getting the error: </p> <pre><code>Subscript indices must either be real positive integers or logicals. </code></pre> <p>Any insight would be much appreciated! </p>
<p>I assume that <code>TeNe</code> is a function which you call with the following inputs: <code>(params,L,I)</code>.<br> However, the output of <a href="http://www.mathworks.com/help/matlab/ref/fminsearch.html" rel="nofollow"><code>fminsearch</code></a> is also assigned to <code>TeNe</code>.<br> That is why, after the first loop iteration you get the error you see. <code>L</code> has been set to <code>0.15</code>, however, this makes no sense as an index to an array called <code>TeNe</code> - which you end up with after running <code>fminsearch</code>.<br> Consider changing the name of the output variable.</p>
