How do I plot the sum of two discrete time signals?
<p>I have x[n] = {1,2,2,1,4} and −1 ≤ n ≤ 5</p> <p>How do I plot y[n] = x[n] + y[n-1]? I am new to matlab, and am not sure how to go about this.</p>
<p>This question does not seem well posed. Your vector for <code>n</code> in your first statement makes no sense (to me) in the context of your second statement. </p> <p>If we ignore the first statement for <code>n</code>, your second statement appears to tell us how to build up a new value of <code>y</code> given <code>x</code> and given the previous previous of <code>y</code>. That's fine. You can easily solve for <code>y</code> with a <code>for</code> loop.</p> <pre><code>x = [1,2,2,1,4]; % this is your given input data y = []; % this is your output for I=1:length(x) % loop over each value of x if (I==1) % the first time through is a special case %assume that the previous value of y is zero y(I) = x(I); else %your given equation y(I) = x(I) + y(I-1); end end y(:) %display y to the screen </code></pre>
<p>The function <code>y[n] = x[n] + y[n-1]</code> is the sum (or discrete integration) of the signal <code>x[n]</code>. You can therefore remove the loop using the MATLAB command <code>cumsum</code> and come up with</p> <pre><code>x = [1,2,2,1,4]; y = cumsum(x); stem(y); % plot y </code></pre>
