Define variable in matlab
<p>i want to define variable like x in Matlab but not a symbolic variable. this is an example of my code here i don't know how to define x except <code>syms x</code>:</p> <p><code>a=[1,2;3,4]; b=a-x*eye(2); c=inv(b);</code></p> <p>really my program is very large and because of define x in <code>syms</code> speed of my program largely reduced i want to define x not in symbolic.</p>
<p><code>syms</code> is a Symbolic Math Toolbox function that creates symbolic variables. Ordinary, non-symbolic variables in MATLAB are created dynamically, simply by assigning to them. For example, <code>x=0</code> creates a variable named <code>x</code> and assigns the scalar value <code>0</code> to it. You don't have to pre-declare x to be a variable; MATLAB figures it out by virtue of the name appearing on the left-hand side of an assignment statement.</p>
