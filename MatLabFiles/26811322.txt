Wavelenth vs Absorbance plot in MATLAB
<p>I have a number of wavelengths and their corresponding absorbances.</p> <p>First I entered the x and y values</p> <pre><code>x = [400 425 450 475 500 505 510 525]; y = [.24 .382 .486 .574 .608 .608 .602 .508]; </code></pre> <p>To plot the points</p> <blockquote> <blockquote> <p>plot(x, y, 'o')</p> </blockquote> </blockquote> <p>Then I want to fit the data. I'm not sure what degree of polynomial to choose, but since it's a plot of Wavelength vs Absorbtion, wont there already be a mathematical formula? Like how you know a plot of Kinetic energy vs Velocity will be degree 2 because KE = 1/2mv^2?</p>
<p>Alright so here is a solution that works fine with your data, using polyfit and polyval to evaluate a polynomial that passes through your data points.</p> <p>In the doc for polyfit (<a href="http://www.mathworks.com/help/matlab/ref/polyfit.html#outputarg_S" rel="nofollow noreferrer">here)</a>, it states that</p> <blockquote> <p>In general, for n points, you can fit a polynomial of degree n-1 to exactly pass through the points.</p> </blockquote> <p>Since you have 8 data points, we can try using a polynomial of degree 7 and see what it givesL</p> <pre><code>clear clc x = [400 425 450 475 500 505 510 525]; y = [.24 .382 .486 .574 .608 .608 .602 .508]; %// Get polynomial coefficients to fit the data p = polyfit(x,y,7) %// Create polynomial to plot fFit = polyval(p,x); plot(x,y,'o') hold on plot(x,fFit,'r--') hold off axis([400 525 0 .7]); legend({'Data points' 'Fitted curve'},'Location','NorthWest') </code></pre> <p>gives this:</p> <p><img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/aBMJ2.jpg" alt="enter image description here"></p> <p>So it does look to work very well! If we look at the coefficients given by polyfit:</p> <pre><code>p = 1.0e+05 * Columns 1 through 6 0.0000 -0.0000 0.0000 -0.0000 0.0000 -0.0003 Columns 7 through 8 0.0401 -2.7206 </code></pre> <p>Maybe the degree 7 was a bit overkill since the first 5 coefficients are 0 ( or about 0), but anyhow it fits very well!</p> <p>Hope that helps!</p>
