reading multiple image from multiple folders in matlab
<p>I have a folder(Enroll) which contain 100 or more sub folders and each of them contain one image. I want to read this image and do some processing on this image. I have problem with how to read them from the different folders ?</p> <p>note * ( the sub folders name is number like : 1, 2,.. " this number arrived from user " ) (the image name is number but different and not sequential like : 433535.bmp , 126554,bmp ,...)</p> <pre><code>foldername=1; // name of the sub folder arrived from user d4= dir('C:\Users\Sarah\Desktop\Log\Log\Enroll\',foldername,'\*.bmp');// here problem when i put foldername variable foldername2=d4(1).name; w=imread(fullfile('C:\Users\Sarah\Desktop\Log\Log\Enroll\',foldername,'\*.bmp', foldername2)); </code></pre> <p>help me please :(</p>
<p><code>foldername</code> is not a string. therefore, you need to make it a string. I believe that what you want is</p> <pre><code>d4= dir(['C:\Users\Sarah\Desktop\Log\Log\Enroll\' num2str(foldername) '\*.bmp']); </code></pre> <p>Note: </p> <p>1- you need to convert from number to string whatever number you have. If <code>foldername</code> is a string, then <code>num2str</code> is not needed.</p> <p>2- You need to concatenate arrays, it doesn't happen automatically. therefore you need to ad the brackets <code>[]</code>.</p>
