return all columns except one matrix
<p>Suppose we have matrix <strong>A</strong> like this:<br/></p> <pre><code> 10 5 8 6 2 A= 9 3 5 4 1 12 5 7 2 6 </code></pre> <p>How can I choose a subset of <strong>A</strong> where there is no third column(for example)??<br/> like this:</p> <pre><code> 10 5 6 2 B = 9 3 4 1 12 5 2 6 </code></pre> <p>I know I can say:</p> <pre><code>B = A(:,[1 2 4 5]); </code></pre> <p>but I need a better way</p>
<p>If we assume that the column to remove is n, it reads:</p> <pre><code>B = A(:,[1:n-1 n+1:end]); </code></pre>
<p>You can use </p> <pre><code>B = A(:,1:size(A,2)~=n); </code></pre> <p>with <code>n</code> as selected column (see answer of @freude).</p> <p>His solution also works fine in any case, but locial indexing (as here) should be faster than his approach.</p>
<p>An alternative, though not a single line, is to copy over and then remove the bit you don't want by setting it to empty:</p> <pre><code>B = A; B(:,n) = []; </code></pre> <p>I mention this because in the case that you don't need <code>B</code> as a new matrix but just want to take one column out of <code>A</code>, this is the simplest/easiest to read way of doing it.</p>
