Update depth map on MATLAB?
<p>I have a global fixed depth gradient of an image <code>G(x,y)</code> and two depth cues including:</p> <ol> <li><p>Texture variation feature <code>T(x,y)</code> that is extracted by applying laws' texture energy masks to the luma information of each block.</p></li> <li><p>Perspective (edge information) feature <code>E(x,y)</code> that is extracted by applying Radon Transform to the luma information of each block within the image. </p></li> </ol> <p>Now I want to refine the depth map based on the extracted features using: the global depth, a linear function of the edge information <code>f(E(x,y))</code> that is monotonically decreasing, and a linear function of the texture energy <code>f(T(x,y))</code> that is monotonically increasing.</p> <p>This can be represented in the following equation:</p> <pre><code>d(x,y) = G(x,y)f(T(x,y))f(E(x,y)) </code></pre> <p>My question is: How can I make the texture energy <code>T(x,y)</code> monotonically decreasing linear function and the edge information <code>E(x,y)</code> monotonically increasing linear function in MATLAB? And how to use them then to refine the depth map?</p>
