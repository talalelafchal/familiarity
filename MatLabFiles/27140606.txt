Finding eigenvalues in a loop matlab
<p>Ok this is how it's supposed to work. In the while loop eigenvalues are calculated for the increments of U in the variable lambda. The idea is to break the while loop once a real part of a variable lambda becomes positive and return the value of U for which this happens. I was trying to use a for loop to do it for a number of k1 values so that in the end I have a vector where in one column I have my k1 values and in the next column values of U for which lambda becomes positive. Hope you get the idea. The problem is that something doesn't seem to be working here and I really can't figure out what. Thanks for help</p> <pre><code>rho=1.225; b=0.2; m=5; I_cg=0.05; k1=2000; k2=1000; c1=10; k_theta=2000; c_theta=2; c=2*b; s=1; x2=0.1; xg=0.04; M=[m -m*xg;-m*xg (m*(xg^2)+I_cg)]; kRoof = 60; for kIndex = 0:kRoof kStart = 2000; k1 = kStart * kIndex; U=0.1; lambda=-1; while (real(lambda)&lt;0) i=1; U(i)=U+i; q=0.5*rho*U(i)^2; B=[((2*pi*q*s*c)/U(i))+c1 (pi*q*s*c)/(5*U(i));-pi*q*s*(c^2)/(2*U(i)) c_theta]; C=[k1+k2 -k2*x2+(2*pi*q*s*c);-k2*x2 (k2*(x2^2)+(k_theta)-(pi*q*s*(c^2)/2))]; A=[M B;zeros(2) M]; D=[zeros(2) C;-M zeros(2)]; lambda=eig(D,-A); i=i+1 U=U+i if imag(lambda)==0 disp(lambda) end end end </code></pre>
