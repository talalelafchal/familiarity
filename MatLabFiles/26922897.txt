How can I calculate the sum of the two matrices have not the same size?
<p>I have 2 matrices ; size A is 256x256 and B is 32x32 ; How can I calculate the sum of the two matrices have not the same size ? please help me .</p>
<p>It depends on how you define the sum. The usual definition of matrix addition, in which corresponding entries are added together, is only defined for matrices of the same size. The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Matrix_addition" rel="nofollow">Wikipedia article on matrix addition</a> mentions two additional types of addition:</p> <ul> <li><p>The direct sum merely embeds the two operands on the diagonal of a new matrix, in your case creating a 288 x 288 matrix.</p></li> <li><p>The Kronecker sum is essentially a block matrix consisting of multiples of B formed from individual elements of A using scalar multiplication.</p></li> </ul>
<p>I've come up with two options, if you have a 32x32 matrix <code>image1</code>, and a 256x256 matrix <code>image2</code>, you could do either <code>imresize(image1,size(image2))+image2</code> or <code>kron(image1,ones(8))</code> (because <code>256/32=8</code>).</p> <p>The <code>imresize</code> method does interpolation and has no requirements on the size of the matrices, but the <code>kron</code> method requires that the size of the matrices are integer multiples of each other, so 32 and 256 is fine, but 32 and 300 wouln't be.</p> <p>Here is my first (32x32) image <img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/3f104.png" alt="enter image description here"> and here is my 256x256 image <img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/Oquug.png" alt="enter image description here"> then here is <code>imresize(image1,size(image2))</code> <img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/Jj2Ay.png" alt="enter image description here"> and here is <code>imresize(image1,size(image2))+image2</code> <img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/2Xa75.png" alt="enter image description here"> here is <code>kron(image1,ones(8))</code> <img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/m7A58.png" alt="enter image description here"> and here is <code>kron(image1,ones(8))+image2</code> <img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/CcJue.png" alt="enter image description here"></p>
