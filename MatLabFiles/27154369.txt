Multiplexer with variable size signals
<p>I am using MATLAB/simulink 2014a and I would like to feed a multiplexer (with 3 ports) with 3 signals which have variable-sizes. But I get the error:</p> <p><img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/JaTl8.png" alt="enter image description here"></p> <p>Someone could help me to solve the problem? </p> <p>Thanks a lot.</p>
<p>First of all thanks for the comments. They helped. I try to write a comprehensive answer in this way if someone has my same question, he/she will find here a possible answer.</p> <ul> <li><p>MULTIPLEXER in SIMULINK don't support Variable-Size signals. You can give a look to which blocks of Simulink support variable-size signals here: <a href="http://it.mathworks.com/help/simulink/ug/simulink-block-support-for-variable-size-signals.html" rel="nofollow">http://it.mathworks.com/help/simulink/ug/simulink-block-support-for-variable-size-signals.html</a> I think the reason is that the components of a mux signal must all have the same data type and cannot be hierarchical.</p></li> <li><p>To workaround this problem one way would be to use the block BUS CREATOR, the following: <a href="http://it.mathworks.com/help/simulink/slref/buscreator.html" rel="nofollow">http://it.mathworks.com/help/simulink/slref/buscreator.html</a></p></li> <li><p>To be more clear you can give a look at the differences between MUX(demux) and bus creator here: <a href="http://fr.mathworks.com/matlabcentral/answers/97787-what-is-the-difference-between-the-mux-demux-and-bus-creator-bus-selector-blocks-in-simulink" rel="nofollow">http://fr.mathworks.com/matlabcentral/answers/97787-what-is-the-difference-between-the-mux-demux-and-bus-creator-bus-selector-blocks-in-simulink</a></p></li> </ul> <p>I hope this will help someone.</p>
