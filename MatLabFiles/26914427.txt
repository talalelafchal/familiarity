How would I create my own linkage function in Matlab?
<p>I've got a little bit of code that clusters data and builds a dendrogram for me, but I want to replace the <code>linkage()</code> function with code of my own, using the single linkage method. I understand in theory how this would work, but I'm having a hard time putting it into Matlab.</p> <p>Are these steps correct? What would this look like written in Matlab?</p> <ol> <li>Define each point in my matrix as a cluster</li> <li>Find the proximity between each of the clusters</li> <li>Group together the two closest clusters as one cluster</li> <li>Repeat steps 2 and 3 until I reach my threshold</li> </ol> <p>Here's my little bit of code if it's of any use:</p> <pre><code>IMG=imread('Fig_Proc.bmp'); %read the image file [x,y]=find(IMG(:,:)==15); %find pixels with a value of 15 (white) FG=[x,y]; %assign our forground to FG %BEGIN tY=pdist(FG); %calculate euclidean distance of FG coordinates Y=squareform(tY); %squareform to get 1241x1241 Z=linkage(Y); %perform single linkage on our matrix dendrogram(Z) %build a dendogram of our data </code></pre> <p>Thanks.</p>
