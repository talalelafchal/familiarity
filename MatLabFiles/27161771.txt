making a movie in matlab for a complex plot
<p>I have written a FEA solver in matlab. I need to plot the results as a movie. but each frame will easily take more than a minute to plot due to the complexity and huge amount of data to plot. Is there any way I can directly save the frames of the plot as a movie, without matlab popping a new frame every few seconds? I need to save these frames into a movie , with matlab doing the work in the background and finally output a movie that is seamless.</p> <p>Thanks in advance!!</p> <p>With Regards</p>
<p>You can use <code>getframe()</code> to grab basically a screenshot of your plot window, then use the <code>VideoWriter</code> class to add these screenshots to a movie that you can play back later. Or you can output the frames from <code>getframe()</code> as a GIF, or as individual images, or whatever, once you have those grabbed images. </p> <p>Here's a hastily coded example:</p> <pre><code>fig = figure(); ax = axes('Parent', fig); writeObj = VideoWriter('C:\path\to\your\folder\VideoName.avi'); open(writeObj); x = 1:10; m = 1:10; for k = 1:numel(m) y = x*m(k); plot(ax, x, y); drawnow; frm = getframe(fig); writeVideo(writeObj, frm); end close(writeObj); </code></pre>
