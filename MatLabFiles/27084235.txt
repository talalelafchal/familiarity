How to find the decision boundary for two set of data for knn classifier
<p>I have two sets,</p> <pre><code>N1 = 10; N2 = 15; % Class sizes set1=[0.333; 0.509; 0.607; 1.172; 0.275; 0.762; 0.850; 0.920; 0.556; -0.046]; set2=[ 0.295; -0.203; -0.097; 0.633; 0.147; 0.356; 0.235; -0.054; -0.024; 0.377; -0.180; 0.512; 0.428; -0.129; 0.094]; </code></pre> <p>I want to find the decision boundary and decision regions for the (3,1)nearest neighbhor classifier. Any ideas, How to do this?</p>
<p>For simply visualizing the decision boundary and decision regions, it is often satisfactory to brute-force test your whole domain of interest. </p> <p>Specifically, you'd define a set of discrete points that span your domain of interest, you'd step through each point evaluating to which class the point belongs, then you'd plot the results.</p> <p>Maybe something like this:</p> <pre><code>%define your domain of interest dx = 0.001; x = [-1.0:dx:2.0]; %step through each point and decide which class it is part of x_class = NaN*ones(size(x)); for I=1:length(x) %apply your KNN decision algorithm here %it outputs a 1 for class 1, or it outputs a 2 for class 2 x_class(I) = my_KNN_algorithm(set1,set2,rules,x(I)); end %plot results plot(x,x_class); hold on; plot(set1,ones(size(set1)),'ro'); plot(set2,2*ones(size(set2)),'gs'); xlabel('Value'); ylabel('Class'); legend('Test Point','Given Set 1','Given Set 2') </code></pre>
