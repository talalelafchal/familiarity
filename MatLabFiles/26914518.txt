Contour plot for 3D vector
<p>I am trying to produce a contour plot for the 3D vectors returned by a custom function in the xy plane where z = 0.</p> <p>I tried this but I just get an empty graph:</p> <pre><code>% Stand in for the real function I want to plot. f = @(x, y, z) [x ^ 2, y ^ 2, x * y + z]; x = linspace(-5, 5, 50); y = linspace(-5, 5, 50); z = zeros(length(x), length(y), 3); % I know this can be vectorized but the function I really want to graph can't % be. for i = 1:length(x) for j = 1:length(y) z(i, j, :) = f(x(i), y(j), 0); end end figure; axis equal; contour(x, y, z); </code></pre>
<p>You should mention what your axis will be. You have <code>x,y</code> and 3 outputs from <code>f</code>. </p> <p>If you consider <code>3</code> outputs of your <code>f</code> as the ones to be plotted then you should use,</p> <pre><code>contour(z(:,:,1),z(:,:,2),z(:,:,3)); </code></pre> <p>Which will give you this,</p> <p><img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/IeoWL.png" alt="enter image description here"></p> <p>I think what you are looking for, is a function with one output, like,</p> <pre><code>f = @(x, y,z) [x ^ 2 + y ^ 2 + x * y + z ]; x = linspace(-5, 5, 50); y = linspace(-5, 5, 50); z = zeros(length(x), length(y)); for i = 1:length(x) for j = 1:length(y) z(i, j) = f(x(i), y(j),0); end end contour(x,y,z,20); </code></pre> <p><img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/xwFi2.png" alt="enter image description here"></p>
