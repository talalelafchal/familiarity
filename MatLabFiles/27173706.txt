&quot;Contour not rendered for non-finite ZData&quot;
<p>I'm trying to plot a frequency characteristic equation using ezplot, but Matlab gives the following warning, "Contour not rendered for non-finite ZData". I have used this command to plot frequency equations previously but now I get a warning and the plot display is empty and it does not change the axis range as well. Can someone please help. Would be much appreciated.</p> <p>Here's the code i'm using. </p> <p>% Transfer Matrix for Case-I, thin rotor</p> <pre><code>clear all; clc; EI = 1626; l = 0.15; m = 0.44108; It = 2.178*10^-4; I_p = 2.205*10^-5; Itr = 0.24; I_pr = 0.479; syms p n; F = [1 l*1i l^2/(2*EI)*1i l^3/(6*EI); 0 1 l/EI -l^2/(2*EI)*1i; 0 0 1 -l*1i; 0 0 0 l]; P = [ 1 0 0 0; 0 1 0 0; 0 -It*p^2+I_p*n*p 1 0; -m*p^2 0 0 1]; P_r = [1 0 0 0; 0 1 0 0; 0 -Itr*p^2+I_pr*n*p 1 0; -m*p^2 0 0 1]; A = F*P*F*P*F*P*F; B = P_r*F*P*F*P*F; r = A(1,2)/A(1,4); a12_p = 0; a22_p = A(2,2)-r*A(2,4); a32_p = A(3,2)-r*A(3,4); a42_p = A(4,2)-r*A(4,4); Ap(2,2) = a22_p; Ap(3,2) = a32_p; Ap(4,2) = a42_p; Ap(4,4) = 1; C = B*Ap; M = [C(3,2) C(3,4); C(4,2) C(4,4)]; sol = det(M); ezplot(sol,[-2*10^10 2*10^10]); </code></pre> <p>The sol is displayed if u ask for it but the plot doesn't display. Thanks in advance for ur help !! Much appreciated.</p>
