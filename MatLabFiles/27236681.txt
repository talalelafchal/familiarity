Matlab error - (and maybe others) not assigned during call
<p>This is my function (fun1.m):</p> <blockquote> <p>function n = F(x)</p> <p>e=exp(1)</p> <p>if (-1&lt;=x &amp; x&lt;=0)</p> <pre><code> n=x; </code></pre> <p>elseif ( 0&lt;=x &amp; x&lt;=1 )</p> <pre><code>n=x.*e.^x; </code></pre> <p>elseif (1&lt;=x &amp; x&lt;=3)</p> <pre><code> n=x^3; </code></pre> <p>end</p> </blockquote> <p>if my x=-1:0.01:3</p> <p>and y=fun1(-0.5) ; y=fun1(0.5) ; y=fun1(2) return correct values, then why</p> <p>y=fun1(x) </p> <p>return:</p> <blockquote> <p>??? Output argument "n" (and maybe others) not assigned during call to "C:\Program Files\MATLAB\R2011a\bin\fun1.m>fun1</p> </blockquote> <p>Help please, I am stuck! I tried simple functions (without ifs/elses) that have array as input, and they are working as intended. Also, if i add to the end of fun1</p> <blockquote> <p>else</p> <p>y=99;</p> </blockquote> <p>it doesn't give me error, but gives me y=99 response. I think that my input is out of bounds, but I don't know how.</p>
<p>First, use &amp;&amp; instead of &amp;.</p> <p>Second, you still may have errors, as your x may be slightly greater than 3 or slightly less than -1 due to precision errors.</p> <p>EDIT: I thought you were iterating through values of x:</p> <pre><code>y = []; for i=1:length(x) y(i) = F(x(i)); end </code></pre>
