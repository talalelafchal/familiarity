How to animated multiple plots?
<p>I try to created some sort plot lines moving from left to right then that I wanted to ask is after the line that moves from left to right then a few moments later there was another line that follows the line so as it would if the first line of the line then there is a second line that trailed I 've tried to make but that I could just like this The first car has reached the end of the next new line coming when the first line of the road may reach a point 100 , and then the second line in the rear had come following the first line at the same speed</p> <p>Here's the code I use:</p> <pre><code>function lalu_lintas X=0:1.0:1000; NX=length(X); function y=f(X) for j=1:NX if X(j)==0 y(j)=1.0; else y(j)=0; end end end c = 1; T=0:1.0:1000; NT=length(T); for i=1:NT i rho=f(X-c*T(i)); plot(X,rho) pause(0.0001) end end </code></pre>
<p>What about using</p> <pre><code>if i &gt; 100 hold on; plot(X-100, rho); hold off end </code></pre> <p>underneath your plot(X,rho)?</p>
