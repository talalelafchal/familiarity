MatLab: Create an 3D array out of x,y,z coordinates and corresponding intensity values
<p>I have a large 2D-array (31100 x 4) built up like this:</p> <p>Intensity | X | Y | Z</p> <p>out of this array I would like to create a 3D-array to visualize it as a 3D-image.</p> <p>I would somehow have to transform the 2D into a 3D-array. Since there will be plenty of points where there is no intensity value available all of these points should be zero values.</p> <p>Side information:</p> <pre><code>min(x) = -152.0120; max(x) = 161.4350; min(y) = -256.2560; max (y) = -52.3801; min(z) = -428.5920; max (z) = -152.4210; </code></pre> <p>Because of the larger number of decimal places I might have to round up. Yet, this would possibly lead to several intensities being assigned to the same coordinate combination. Logically, I would have to add up the intensities in these cases.</p> <p>This makes everything really complicated.</p> <p>I would be happy if someone could teach me how to transform a 2D into a 3D array with zero-values for spots without intensity values.</p> <p>Thanks for reading.</p>
