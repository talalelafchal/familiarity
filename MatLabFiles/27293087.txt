create a class and calling its methods
<p>I have set a path in my pathdef (C:\MyFolder\Classes) where I have the BankAccount and AccountManager class examples from MATLAB, I have just added Test to the end of each name for testing purposes.</p> <p>So when in a different path I can run the line below and it works fine. I step through and see it open the BankAccountTest file.</p> <pre><code> mb = BankAccountTest(12345, 1000); </code></pre> <p>Now I have tried adding a new class say called MyFuncs to the same directory as the classes above. </p> <pre><code>classdef MyFuncs methods(Static) function [mynum] = test_func(intOne, intTwo) mynum = intOne * intTwo; end end end </code></pre> <p>When I try the line below</p> <pre><code> nm = MyFuncs.test_func(5, 6); </code></pre> <p>I get the error message,</p> <pre><code>Undefined variable "MyFuncs" or class "MyFuncs.test_func". </code></pre> <p>Why can it not 'see' this class but it can see the others?</p> <p><strong>Answer</strong></p> <p>Closing my Matlab and and re-opening it seems to have done the trick</p>
