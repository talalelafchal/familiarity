matlab: how do I do animated plot in a figure of two subplot
<p>There is example of the web that shows how to do animated plot in a single figure. </p> <p>However, I want to do two subplots in a single figure, such that they will show animation in a first subplot, and then the animation ina second subplot.</p> <p>Using <code>'figure(1)'</code> or <code>'figure (2)'</code> and <code>'hold on'</code>, I can do the animation plot as follows. However, How do I call the subplot to do the similiar things?</p> <p>So the effect I am looking for is: 1) figure that is opened and has two subplot. 2) plot the animated curve in the 1st subplot, then plot the animated curve in the 2nd subplot. 3) I want to go back to the 1st subplot to plot more things, and also go to 2nd subplot to plot more things. </p> <pre><code>figure(1); hold on; x = 1:1000; y = x.^2; %// Plot starts here figure,hold on %// Set x and y limits of the plot xlim([min(x(:)) max(x(:))]) ylim([min(y(:)) max(y(:))]) %// Plot point by point for k = 1:numel(x) plot(x(k),y(k),'-') %// Choose your own marker here %// MATLAB pauses for 0.001 sec before moving on to execue the next %%// instruction and thus creating animation effect pause(0.001); end </code></pre>
<p>Just do the <code>subplot</code>'s in the loop:</p> <pre><code>for k = 1:numel(x) subplot(1,2,1) plot(x(k),y(k),'-') %// Choose your own marker here subplot(1,2,2) plot(x(1:k),y(1:k)) %// MATLAB pauses for 0.001 sec before moving on to execue the next %%// instruction and thus creating animation effect pause(0.001); end </code></pre>
