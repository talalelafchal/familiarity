MATLAB find the point of a value obtained using min
<p>I want to match a time to the minimum value of TEMP found in an array that I'm reading into a struct from a netcdf file in a loop (that's doing a lot more stuff - no I don't want to get rid of the loop). I have the snctools so that's what I'm using for netcdfs. </p> <p>Here's my current relevant lines of code:</p> <pre><code>%Get the netcdf file with file_string loading into MATLAB nc=netcdf(file_string); %Work out the number of files I need to loop through [files]=dir('*.nc'); max1=length(files); for d1=1:max1 %extract the TEMP 1-D array B1=nc{'TEMP'}(:) %assign to value dat.TEMP_min(d1)= min(B1); end </code></pre> <p>Now there is another variable of the same length called 'TIMES'. If min(B1)=10.5 and is the nth element of B1 then I want to locate the nth element of TIMES and save it as dat.TEMP_min_TIME. How would I go about this?</p> <p>Please provide enough notes on any code so that a novice can understand it.</p>
<p>You can just use inside your loop (sorry for pseudocode, not sure about your definitions of n and TIMES)</p> <pre><code>[M,I] = min(B1); dat.TEMP_min(d1)= M; if (I == n) dat.TEMP_min_TIME = nc1{'TIMES'}(I); % end </code></pre>
