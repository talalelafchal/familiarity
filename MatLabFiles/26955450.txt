Reading AES1660 fingerprint sensor in MATLAB
<p>I have searched google for Fingerprint reader interfacing with MATLAB. But all the result I got is about fingerprint recognition. I actually looking for some way to integrate and read my fingerprint sensor which is built in my Laptop. According to driver it says its name as AES1660. It works pretty fine with its utility comes with driver of that sensor. </p> <p>I there any stander way to use such fingerprint sensors in MATLAB? Should I needed some SDK? What if I dond find any SDK? I also tried to find out any documentation about that sensor that may help but in vain. The main idea is to reuse old laptops which have fingerprint sensors integrated with them. </p> <p>I am not sure if such type of questions are valid for stackoverflow or not. But I am posting here because My question is to look some programmatic way to interface sensors with MATLAB. How to access such sensors in MATLAB? Thanks </p>
