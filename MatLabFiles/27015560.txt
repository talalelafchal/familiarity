How to get co-ordinates of a contour of a binary image?
<p>I have a binary image and I want to extract the co-ordinates of the contour of the binary image.The built in contour() functions resulted in double values, but instead I want the array i.e. series of (x,y) of the contour.It is also ok if the co ordinates are in polar (x+iy) form. Can anyone help me please ? </p>
<p>You can get you contour mask by eroding your mask with a simple small structure element (disk/square)</p> <pre><code>con = BW &amp; ~imerode( BW, [0 1 0; 1 1 1; 0 1 0] ); figure; imshow( con ); title('contour mask'); [cy cx] = find(con); %// get coordinates of contour pixels </code></pre> <hr> <p>Coming to think about it, there are several (related) functions for tracing boundaries of binary masks in the image processing toolbox.</p> <p>Have you tried <a href="http://www.mathworks.com/help/images/ref/bwtraceboundary.html" rel="nofollow"><code>bwtraceboundary</code></a> or <a href="http://www.mathworks.com/help/images/ref/bwboundaries.html" rel="nofollow"><code>bwboundaries</code></a>?</p>
