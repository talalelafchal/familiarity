Designing bandstop filter for positive and negative frequencies with MATLAB
<p>I have two WAV files of the same sound recording, but one contains background noise and the other does not. I am trying to use a <strong>bandstop filter</strong> to filter the one that contains background noise.</p> <p>I have found the <strong>fft</strong> of both signals and graphed them. I have determined two symmetric areas (one with positive frequencies and one with negative frequencies) on the graph of the noisy signal that should be filtered out. The <strong>bandstop filter</strong> does not use negative frequencies, so I am wondering how I can possibly filter both of these areas out. </p> <p>Also, how do I find what frequencies these areas on my graphs are? </p>
