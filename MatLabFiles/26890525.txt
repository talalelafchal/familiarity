grow line from a point on both sides along angles with x axis
<p>I have a portrait picture as input. After pre-processing, I only keep the region of hair as what I need. After convolved with <strong>Gabor</strong> filter banks, I get estimated orientation at every pixels. </p> <p>Here's my problem. I have a set of seed pixels, and I want grow 2D hair strand segments from seed pixel along its orientation on both sides.</p> <p>If the seed point is</p> <p><code>p(x,y)</code>,</p> <p>forward tracing is</p> <p><code>p1 = (x+step*sin(theta), y-step*cos(theta))</code>,</p> <p>backward tracing is</p> <p><code>p0 = (x-step*sin(theta), y0+step*cos(theta))</code>,</p> <p>the step is <code>75%</code> unit pixel width. In order to get smooth line segment, the orientation of new position is bilinear interpolated by its nearest 4 neighbors. But unfortunately, I didn't get good results. Can anybody help me to check out what's happening? Thanks a lot.</p> <p>Input image: </p> <p><img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/KFuaj.jpg" alt="input"></p> <p>Traced line segments: </p> <p><img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/dMbit.jpg" alt="segments"></p> <p>I just want to implement the 2D hair generation method of this paper: Single-View Hair Modeling for Portrait Manipulation</p>
