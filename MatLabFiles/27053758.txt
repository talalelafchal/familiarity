Variable initialization in genetic algorith coding in Matlab
<p>I am writing a genetic algorithm code in matlab and I want to initialize a variable called <code>b</code>, while it is a continuous variable between 0 and 40, I want matlab start it with 40 and continue calculating it during the ga process. I defined <code>b=0+40.*rand(25,12);</code> so it gives a random marix of 25 &amp; 12 between 0 &amp; 40. But I want the matlab to start with <code>b=40</code> and then continue the calculation. Could you please help me to solve this issue? Thanks for any help regards Elnaz </p>
