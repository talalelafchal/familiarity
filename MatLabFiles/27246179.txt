R best way to produce and edit interactive plots like in MATLAB?
<p>It used to be the case that MATLAB was better at creating interactive plots. This is, plots were one was able to use the mouse to interactively change certain aspects of the plot, like the height and width, the x and y limits, position of the legend, ... akin of having the plot creation and and svg editor all in the same place.</p> <p>What is the best way to achieve the same goal in open source R? The alternative being, produce the plot with R, save it as pdf or svg, then open the file with an open source svg editor like Inkscape, and edit the layout of the plot as a second step.</p> <p>Is there any R package that does that in place?</p>
<p>There are a few <code>R</code> packages which allow you to jump into either the Tcl or OpenGL world of interactive graphics (and I believe some X11 tools as well). Further, there is a package, whose name sadly escapes me at the moment, which runs "on top of" the base plotting tools and lets you do some of that interactive rescaling work.</p> <p>However, I strongly suggest you spend a little time learning <code>ggplot</code> and change your approach to graphics generation. Unless your intent is to manipulate a graph in realtime for, e.g., a presentation, it's really more efficient to edit the <code>grob</code> object and replot until you get the image you want.</p> <p>Remember, The First Rule of Efficient Programming (TM) is "You DO NOT USE THE MOUSE" (with apologies to Tyler Durden). </p>
