Understanding output of cylinder function
<p>I am using matlab's cylinder function i.e. [X,Y,Z]=cylinder(radius);</p> <p>But the values of X,Y,Z contain two rows.</p> <p>Can someone please explain why two rows are coming. What does row=1 represents and what does row=2 represents.</p>
<p>The cylinder surface is not a function, so each (X,Y) pair is corresponding to different Z values (in your case - 0 and 1). If you look at the value you are getting, you will notice that for X and Y you are getting the same data in both rows, for Z you will get different rows.</p>
<p>Just to complement @Eugene's answer, both rows do indeed correspond to the possible Z-positions of your data points. Since the radius does not vary with the cylinder's Z position, you only get 2 rows. </p> <p>In the simple case where the radius is a constant, if you plot both rows separately you can see what they represent:</p> <pre><code>hFig = figure('Visible','off') [x,y,z]=cylinder(5); set(hFig,'Visible','on') plot3(x(1,:),y(1,:),z(1,:)) hold on plot3(x(2,:),y(2,:),z(2,:),'-r') hold off </code></pre> <p>Giving this:</p> <p><img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/P5GUH.jpg" alt="enter image description here"></p> <p>where both planes (i.e. z-positions) are of different colors.</p> <p>However, let's consider the following, in which the cylinder's z-position is more complex:</p> <pre><code>t = 0:pi/10:2*pi; figure [X,Y,Z] = cylinder(2+cos(t)); surf(X,Y,Z) axis square </code></pre> <p>Then X,Y and Z will have 21 rows, corresponding to the possible Z-positions of the cylinder (i.e. <code>length(t) +1</code>):</p> <p><img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/Yajng.jpg" alt="enter image description here"></p>
