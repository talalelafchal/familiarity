Nested python lists imported from Matlab
<p>I am importing a large struct from Matlab to Python using the scipy.io. The data seems to be imported OK, but it is full of nested lists, which I am not able to simplify. Here's one of the simplest examples:</p> <pre><code>sc = sio.loadmat(matlabFile) sc['DieID']['w'] </code></pre> <p>which results in the following output:</p> <pre><code>array([[array([[ 1309.09090909]]), array([[ 1309.09090909]]), array([[1000]], dtype=uint16)]], dtype=object) </code></pre> <p>Could you please suggest how do I reduce this particular field to a simple list [1309.09090909, 1309.09090909, 1000]?</p> <p>Thank you for your help!</p>
