How to remove a scalar structure in MATLAB?
<p>I have this code that filters through files and loads them to create this weird cell (2D inside a 2D?)array. I just need a vector of all these numbers in the end. Is there a way to get rid of these layers and condense it down, whether in the loop or after the fact?</p> <pre><code>slopes = dir('*Slope.m');%find all the files containing the name slope num = numel(slopes); file = cell(1,num); %Preallocate for k = 1:num file{k} = slopes(k).name; %taking name from file and making list final{k}=load(file{k}) %loading contents of each file end ans= final = { [1,1] = scalar structure containing the fields: Slope = { [1,1] = -1.1921 -1.0496 -1.5440 -8.0588 -1.5505 -2.0916 -1.8253 1.5526 2.8496 } [1,2] = scalar structure containing the fields: Slope = { [1,1] = -1.2797 -1.0386 -2.7018 -2.4564 -1.5939 -2.6885 -1.2366 2.0501 } </code></pre> <p>Thanks for the help!</p>
<p>I'm sure this was answered several times but it's just a common one liner in matlab:</p> <pre><code>flat_final = [final{:}] </code></pre> <p>To make the answer more complete you could use <code>horzcat</code>, <code>vertcat</code> and <code>reshape</code> to finetune your results. </p> <p>The technical term for your task is <em>flatten</em> so you might find many more snippets if you search for it. </p>
