Matlab: Draw multiple images in a single axis on various coordinates
<p>I would like to visualize a unoriented graph, where icons (bitmaps) are placed on nodes and branches stand for lines. </p> <p>I have a problem to draw multiple images in a single axis on various coordinates. Is there any possibility how to resolve this problem in Matlab?</p> <p>Thanks, Martin</p>
<p>Use <a href="http://es.mathworks.com/help/images/ref/subimage.html" rel="nofollow noreferrer"><code>subimage</code></a>.</p> <p>Example (with three admittedly very dull icons...):</p> <pre><code>im1 = randn(20,20,3); %// example icon. MxNx3 (RGB) array. M, N arbitrary im2 = .5*ones(20,20,3); %// another icon im3 = .5+.5*rand(20,20,3); %// yet another hold on subimage(50,150,im1) %// change 100,300 to desired coordinates subimage(100,50,im2) subimage(150,100,im3) axis([0 200 0 200]) %// set size. By default axes just enclose the subimages axis equal %// set equal scale in both axes </code></pre> <p><img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/OLquO.png" alt="enter image description here"></p>
