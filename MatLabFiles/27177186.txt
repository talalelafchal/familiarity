How do i find and change the max value to 1 and the min value to 0 based on my 4x800 data in MATLAB?
<p>I have a 4x800 data. I need to find the max and min value by column and based on the result. I have to change the max value to 1 and the min value to 0. This is my code:</p> <pre><code>M = A==repmat(max(A),size(A,1),1); M( cumsum(M)&gt;1 ) = 0; filename = 'result10.xlsx'; xlswrite(filename,M); </code></pre> <p>As you can see, I am also writing the results to an Excel file. However, when I open up the file in Excel, it shows true and false values. How do I make the values become 1 and 0?</p>
<p>The reason why it is writing <code>true/false</code> to your XLS file is because <code>M</code> is a <strong>logical</strong> array. To make this <code>0/1</code> <strong>cast your matrix to <code>double</code></strong> before writing to your XLS file. Therefore:</p> <pre><code>M = A==repmat(max(A),size(A,1),1); M( cumsum(M)&gt;1 ) = 0; M = double(M); %// CHANGE IS HERE filename = 'result10.xlsx'; xlswrite(filename,M); </code></pre> <p>The above will make your values floating point. If you want them to be integer, cast them to some integer type, like <code>int32</code>, <code>uint8</code>, etc. (tip of the hat goes to Robert P. for this small tip!)</p>
