Vector in Matlab + input
<p>I'm a beginner and trying to create a vector with same values but a few:</p> <p>X = [4, 0, 0, 0, 6, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 56, 0, 0, 0] works for small vectors.</p> <p>But if its a problem with hundreds of values it quickly runs out of hand.</p> <p>Or this one that repeat same value into a vector: ones(1,14) * 0 But I have no idea how to get the 4, 6, 56 into that vector.</p> <p>I would also want to learn how I can make an input commando while creating the vector 1 for example position 1 (which now is 4). Can I make a vector to I decide the value at that position?</p> <p>P = input('Decide value for n=1 in X:');</p> <p>Then i write P = input('Decide value for n=1 in X:');</p> <p>I thought something like this could be useful but i dont know how to proceed</p> <p>ones(1,14) * P,4</p> <p>Thanks!</p>
<p>Rather than use <code>ones(1,14)*0</code>, you can just use <code>zeros(1,14)</code></p> <p>To add in your specific values, you can set the value of the vector at an index directly:</p> <pre><code>X(1) = 4 X(5) = 6 X(11) = 56 </code></pre> <p>To combine this with user input, try something along the lines of:</p> <pre><code>X(1) = input('Pick value for index 1 of X: ') </code></pre> <p>Note that this does not include any error checking of the input</p> <p>Also, if you want to get the entire matrix from an input one value at a time, you don't even need to initialize the matrix first. For example:</p> <pre><code>for i=1:10 X(i) = input(strcat('Pick a number for index ', num2str(i), ' of X: ')); end </code></pre> <p>You could also just prompt the user for a vector instead</p> <pre><code>X = input('Enter a vector') </code></pre>
