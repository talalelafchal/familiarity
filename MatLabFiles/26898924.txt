Matlab mex &amp; fortran free compiler
<p>Have a bunch of mex files for a research project that needs to be compiled in/through Matlab. This, as I have read, should be done via for example Intel Visual Fortran and MS Visual c++. Have downloaded and installed MS SDK 7.1 which contains the last one but for compiling Fortran I can´t find anything available (at least not for free). Anyone have an idea what I should do/know some other Fortran compiler that works? </p>
<p>It depends on which release of MATLAB you are using. Supported compilers are listed on the MathWorks web site. The ones for the latest release are at <a href="http://uk.mathworks.com/support/compilers/R2014b/index.html" rel="nofollow noreferrer">Supported and Compatible Compilers – Release 2014b</a>, with older releases linked from that page on the left-hand side:</p> <p><img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/aIXIR.jpg" alt="enter image description here"></p>
