How can I make MEX files created by the Coder toolkit usable by others
<p>I have created a MEX file using MATLAB's Coder toolkit, and it works perfectly fine on my computer, however, when I sent it to someone else for their use, it error and would not work.</p> <p><strong>What are the proper steps for properly distributing and allowing others to be able to use my MEX file/code?</strong></p> <p>On a side note, (im not sure how much this affects my issue) but in the C code file that the coder created, it has variables that lead to directories on my computer, instead of having relative pathing.</p>
<p>Installing the <a href="http://www.mathworks.com/products/compiler/mcr/" rel="nofollow">MCR</a> (my original advice) only applies to compiler generated code, although you still need a compatible libmx and libmat. I thought perhaps they could get a hold of them through the installer, but they'd really need to update MATLAB if it were incompatible (v6 vs v7).</p> <p>In general, avoid paths in your deployed code.</p>
