Creating a script that will allow the user to input values repeatedly until each case has been entered
<p>I'm trying to create a script that will allow the user to input x-values repeatedly until each case has been entered. I have three possible cases: </p> <ul> <li>Case 1 is entered when <code>x &lt;= 7</code></li> <li>Case 2 is entered when <code>7 &lt;= x &lt;= 12</code>. </li> <li>Case 3 is entered when <code>x &gt; 12</code></li> </ul> <p>I want to use a <code>while</code> statement to error-check the user input, ensuring that <code>x &gt; 0</code>. Each time a case is entered, I want to print the case number &amp; the created y-value:</p> <ul> <li><code>y = x^3 + 3</code> for case 1</li> <li><code>y = (x-3)/2</code> for case 2</li> <li><code>y = 4*x+3</code> for case 3</li> </ul> <p>No case may be ran twice. The script will output something like 'That case has been run already' should this happen. Once all cases have been entered, I want to print something like 'All cases have been entered'.</p> <p>Here is what I have tried so far:</p> <pre><code> counter1 = 0; counter2 = 0; counter3 = 0; while counter1==0 || counter2==0 || counter3==0 x = input('Please enter an x value &gt; 0: '); while x &lt; 0 x = input('Invalid! Please enter another x value &gt; 0: '); end if counter1&gt;=1 || counter2&gt;=1 || counter3&gt;=1 disp('That case has been run already'); elseif x&lt;=7 counter1 = counter1 + 1; y = x.^3 + 3; fprintf('Case 1: y = %d \n',y); elseif 7&lt;x &amp;&amp; x&lt;=12 counter2 = counter2 + 1; y = (x-3)./2; fprintf('Case 2: y = %d \n',y); elseif x&gt;12 counter3 = counter3 + 1; y = 4.*x+3; fprintf('Case 3: y = %d \n',y); else counter1==1 &amp;&amp; counter2==1 &amp;&amp; counter3==1; end end disp('All cases have been entered!') </code></pre> <p>The only thing I can't seem to get to work now is this part:</p> <pre><code> if counter1&gt;=1 || counter2&gt;=1 || counter3&gt;=1 disp('That case has been run already'); </code></pre> <p>It seems to be ignored entirely. Any suggestions?</p>
<p>Do away with all of your <code>counter</code> variables. Have <code>boolean / logical</code> flags instead that indicate when a particular case has been performed. Also, you would want to check if a particular case has already been performed inside each case itself. Don't do this as a separate external <code>if</code> statement. This is probably why that statement you originally wrote isn't working. As such, do something like this. I'll put <code>%//NEW</code> where I have added in new code:</p> <pre><code> case1 = false; %// NEW case2 = false; %// NEW case3 = false; %// NEW while ~case1 || ~case2 || ~case3 %// NEW: While at least one of the cases has not been run... x = input('Please enter an x value &gt; 0: '); while x &lt; 0 x = input('Invalid! Please enter another x value &gt; 0: '); end if x &lt;= 7 %// NEW if case1 %// NEW: Check if case #1 has already been run %// If it has, show this to the user, then continue in the loop fprintf('Case #1 has already been run!\n'); continue; %// NEW - Continue through the loop. Don't do anything else end case1 = true; %// NEW - Set to true if we haven't run this case already y = x.^3 + 3; fprintf('Case 1: y = %d \n',y); elseif 7&lt;x &amp;&amp; x&lt;=12 if case2 %// NEW - Repeat like Case #1 here fprintf('Case #2 has already been run!\n'); %// NEW continue; %// NEW end case2 = true; %// NEW y = (x-3)./2; fprintf('Case 2: y = %d \n',y); elseif x&gt;12 if case3 %// NEW - Repeat like Case #3 here fprintf('Case #3 has already been run!\n'); %// NEW continue; %// NEW end case3 = true; %// NEW y = 4.*x+3; fprintf('Case 3: y = %d \n',y); end %// End if end %// End while disp('All cases have been entered!') %// Display once all cases have been entered </code></pre> <hr> <p>Here's a sample run for you showing that it works:</p> <pre><code>Please enter an x value &gt; 0: -1 Invalid! Please enter another x value &gt; 0: 3 Case 1: y = 30 Please enter an x value &gt; 0: 2 Case #1 has already been run! Please enter an x value &gt; 0: 8 Case 2: y = 2.500000e+00 Please enter an x value &gt; 0: 10 Case #2 has already been run! Please enter an x value &gt; 0: 14 Case 3: y = 59 All cases have been entered! </code></pre> <hr> <p>I put in -1 to try and see if it rejects negative numbers, which is does. I put in a number that's <code>&lt; 7</code>, which is 3. It enters the first case successfully. I try to put in another number that's <code>&lt; 7</code>, which is 2. It gives the message saying Case #1 has already been run. I try to put in a number that's between 7 and 12... so I try 8. It generates Case #2 accordingly. I try again with 10, and it says that Case #2 has already been run. Lastly, I try 14, which is <code>&gt; 12</code>, it generates Case #3 and stops as all cases have been successfully run.</p> <p>This I believe is what you were looking for.</p>
