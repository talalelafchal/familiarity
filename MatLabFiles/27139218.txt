C# Fast Matrix Manipulation
<p>Having a matrix like this in C# </p> <pre><code>double[,] M </code></pre> <p>I would like to get the same fast manipulation of its content as Matlab does. In particular, having this code in Matlab:</p> <pre><code>for i = 1:N M(i, 1:i) = 1; </code></pre> <p>I would like to have its equivalent in C# without a second loop. I'm not sure about this, but as far as I know, Matlab uses a process called Vectorization for this line <code>M(i, 1:i) = 1</code>, which is faster than me implementing a for loop from 1 to i setting each cell to 1. Maybe I'm wrong, please correct me.</p> <p>So how can achieve a fast manipulation of matrices in C# like Matlab. </p>
<p>A common solution is to use a matrix library like <a href="http://numerics.mathdotnet.com/" rel="nofollow">math.net numerics</a> for matrix operations.</p>
