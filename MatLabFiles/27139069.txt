how to detect if one signal is increasing in amplitude and another in decreasing at the same window
<p>I have to signals as shown below and I need to detect if one signal is increasing in amplitude and another in decreasing at the a specific time window and vice versa. I tried findpeaks function but it didn't detect the big peak shown below .. it detects all the small peaks which I don't need them.. any help?</p> <p><img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/iUB56.png" alt="enter image description here"></p>
<p>using <code>sign(diff(signal))</code> can help, you can use <code>sgolayfilt</code> for noise reduction.</p> <pre><code>L = 100; Fs = 50; t = (0 : L - 1) / Fs ; n = .3 * rand([1 L]); s1 = sin(2 * pi * .8 * t) + n; s2 = cos(2 * pi * .8 * t) + n; subplot(311) plot(t,s1,'b'); hold on plot(t,s2,'m'); subplot(312) s1 = sgolayfilt(s1,3,13); s2 = sgolayfilt(s1,3,13); t(end) = []; plot(t,sign(diff(s1)),'b') ylim([-2 2]) subplot(313) plot(t,sign(diff(s2)),'m') ylim([-2 2]) </code></pre> <p><img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/BJ6q2.png" alt="enter image description here"></p> <p>If your signals are clean then the results will be better.</p> <p><img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/2nfhl.png" alt="enter image description here"></p>
<p>Compute the slopes for the period and see whether they have opposing sign.</p>
