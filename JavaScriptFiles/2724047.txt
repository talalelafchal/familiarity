What is the best way to implement search on my site using google search?
<p>I'm developing a simple site for local student contest. I want to implement some <strong>basic search functionality</strong> (just a textbox with submitButton or submitLink). The site contains several pages with static informational content there, and one google-forms iframe(register for the event). </p> <p>Is it a good idea to implement my search with javascript which redirects user to something like <a href="http://www.google.ru/search?q=BLAH+BLAH+site:mysite.com" rel="nofollow noreferrer">http://www.google.ru/search?q=BLAH+BLAH+site:mysite.com</a> ?</p> <p>The less code, the better. Server-side code would not be great, but still ok.</p> <p>Thank you.</p>
<p>Have a look at the Google Custom Search Engine: <a href="http://www.google.com/cse/" rel="nofollow noreferrer">http://www.google.com/cse/</a></p> <p>It's extremely simple to set up, basically it's just a matter of copy pasting and as far as I understand, it will give you exactly what you want.</p>
