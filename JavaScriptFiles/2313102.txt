Connection to ODBC in very restricted environment (sort of challenge)
<p>I usually type too much, so <strong>read bold copy if in a hurry</strong>.</p> <p>I'm trying to develop a little app in a very restrictive environment (at work)... I want to read data from a database, but I cant install stuff on my machine (so my usual choice of using python or visual studio is a no-no). Basically I will have to do with whatever I've got at hand...</p> <p><strong>What solution can you come up with to access an odbc connection and read the records of a table in an environment where you can't install any software?</strong> feel free to suggest any language, as long as you don't need to install anything.</p> <p>My best idea so far is trying to use the web-browser (since i only need notepad to code), so... basically using only HTML and javascript to try to access it (although I have no clue how to acomplish that task, as I've never done it before)...</p> <p>I know it is not a good idea, but since I won't post this on internet (I only I would have access to this from my desk, and the DB is on my local network), I don't think security is an issue.</p> <p>Even if I don't get a solution, I would like to hear what would you guys try if the need arose. But any ideas or links pointing me in the right direction would be appreciated.</p> <p>Edit: For clarity's sake, it is a Windows environment.</p>
<p>You could use <a href="http://www.portablepython.com/" rel="nofollow noreferrer">Portable Python</a>, and <a href="http://portableapps.com/apps/development/notepadpp_portable" rel="nofollow noreferrer">Portable Notepad++</a>. That way, you'll have nothing to install, and you'll still be able to use your preferred language.</p> <p>If you like Django, you can have all that in a portable bundle : <a href="http://www.instantdjango.com/" rel="nofollow noreferrer">Instant Django</a></p>
<p>If you have a web server on the db machine, you could write a Java (not javascript) application to access the db using java connector (or odbc). That's assuming Java is already installed on your machine.</p> <p>Another possibility is to write an AJAX application to access the data server-side.</p>
<p>You don't mention OS or why the environment is so locked down, but if it's a managed Windows environment, you probably have Office installed. You may find that you can connect using Excel. (In 2003, it's under data -> import external data -> new database query, which brings up a list of ODBC connections.) Heck, if Office is installed, maybe you'll even have the Ultimate Root of All Evil program (a.k.a. MS Access).</p>
<p>Not sure if you are on windows or not, but if you are: cscript.exe</p> <p>If you have access to notepad you should be able to do it:</p> <p>Something along these lines:</p> <pre><code>option explicit dim conn : set conn = wscript.createobject("ADODB.connection") conn.open("Driver={SQL Server};Server=127.0.0.1\sqlexpress;Database=tinker;Trusted_Connection=Yes;") dim sql : sql = "select * from demos" dim rs : set rs = conn.execute(SQL) dim line dim cnt line = "" for cnt = 0 to rs.fields.count-1 line = line &amp; CHR(9) &amp; rs.fields(cnt).name next wscript.echo line while not rs.eof line = "" for cnt = 0 to rs.fields.count-1 line = line &amp; CHR(9) &amp; rs.fields(cnt).value next wscript.echo line rs.movenext wend </code></pre> <p>Save that to a text file with a .vbs extension and run it with cscript</p>
