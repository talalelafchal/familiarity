Getting the text under the mouse pointer
<p>I'm writing a browser add-on and want to get the word / words the user is currently hovering over via Javascript.</p>
<p>There's no good general purpose function to do that. If you specify which browser you're adding on to, there might be a specific workaround. When faced with this problem in the past, I had to resort to asking the user to double-click the word (then you can detect the double-click, get selection, and reset it back).</p>
<p>One option is to place every word inside its own <code>&lt;span&gt;</code> element and adding a <code>mouseover</code> handler to the body that checks the event's <code>target</code> / <code>srcElement</code> property to retrieve the span and therefore the word. This has significant downsides: the initial process of surrounding each word with a span could be slow; the new spans could mess up existing CSS rules; the document would end up with loads of elements that have no semantic value.</p>
<p>My guess is that you cannot get this done unless every word is in its own container like etc and you have declared a onmouseover handler for this. An easier approach would be use the currentSelection element when a user double clicks or mouse selects a piece of text on the browser. You could write on mouse click/doubleclick events for this. </p>
