Can JavaScript retrieve a file that is above the web root?
<p>Is it possible to make JavaScript retrieve a file that is above the web root?</p> <pre><code>function sendurl(url) { if(document.images){ (new Image()).src="../recieve_url.php?url="+url; } return true; } </code></pre>
<p>JavaScript is able to retrieve whatever the web server is capable of serving. By definition, web servers do not normally serve anything behind the main <a href="http://httpd.apache.org/docs/2.0/mod/core.html#documentroot" rel="nofollow noreferrer">document root</a>.</p>
<p>Whether or not such a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Directory_traversal" rel="nofollow noreferrer">directory traversal attack</a> is possible has absolutely nothing to do with JavaScript (unless you run it server-side). HTTP requests initiated by JavaScript are no different than those initiated by you clicking on a link.</p> <p>What it <em>does</em> depend on is the webserver and the server-side code that runs there - which often needs to be able to access files outside the web root and, if programmed carelessly, can often be tricked into doing directory traversal and returning the results.</p>
