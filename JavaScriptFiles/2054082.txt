JavaScript alert with 3 buttons
<p>I have a JavaScript alert button that appears on the website when a user is going to proceed to a signup page. </p> <p>It looks something like this</p> <p>Would you like to proceed to the signup page?<br> &lt; OK > &lt; Cancel ></p> <p>Would it be possible to add a third button to the alert so that it looks like</p> <p>Would you like to proceed to the signup page?<br> &lt; More Info > &lt; OK > &lt; Cancel ></p>
<p>No.</p> <p>You need to use a custom modal dialog, such as <a href="http://jqueryui.com/demos/dialog/" rel="nofollow noreferrer">jQuery UI Dialog</a>.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, I don't think you can change the number of buttons in an alert box. (At least not in any browser that I know of.) You can use one of the many modal dialog scripts that are out on the net. Something like Eric Martin's <a href="http://www.ericmmartin.com/projects/simplemodal/" rel="nofollow noreferrer">SimpleModal Dialog</a> for jquery would probably work. </p> <p>They basically take a div and style it up with css and javascript to mimic a dialog box. </p>
<p>however you can use confirm function.. but NOT three buttons.</p> <pre><code>var r=confirm("Press a button!"); if (r==true) { x="You pressed OK!"; } else { x="You pressed Cancel!"; } </code></pre>
