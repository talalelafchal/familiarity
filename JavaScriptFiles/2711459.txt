<p>I think, if popups are blocked, <code>window.open()</code> will return a <code>null</code>, not a window object. You can read it in an <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ms537632(v=VS.85).aspx" rel="nofollow noreferrer">MSDN article</a>:</p> <blockquote> <p>If you are not sure whether a pop-up window is blocked, check your functions that return a window object. You can tell if a pop-up window has been blocked if these functions return null. In particular, you need to check the value of window.open to avoid script errors when your pop-up windows are blocked.</p> </blockquote> <p>Also, this will give you some hints about detection of popup blockers: <a href="http://www.visitor-stats.com/articles/detect-popup-blocker.php" rel="nofollow noreferrer">http://www.visitor-stats.com/articles/detect-popup-blocker.php</a></p>
<p>You need to give us the Javascript you are using so that we can help. You will need an 'if' statement.</p> <p>Display alerts like this in javascript:</p> <p>alert('Please turn off your pop-up blocker');</p>
<p>When you create a new window using <code>window.open()</code>, it returns a handle to the (theoretically) opened window. You can then test that handle to determine whether the window is open:</p> <pre><code>var child = window.open("mypopup.html"); // some popup blockers prevent the window from being created (!child) and // others just close them before they're displayed (child.closed) if (!child || child.closed) { // tell the user to turn off their popup blocker } </code></pre> <p>Popups are very intrusive, however, and you should consider trying to display the "popup" information within the page. In particular, have a look at "dialog" scripts. If you're using jQuery, a very nice <a href="http://docs.jquery.com/UI/Dialog" rel="nofollow noreferrer">Dialog widget</a> is included in the <a href="http://jqueryui.com/" rel="nofollow noreferrer">jQuery UI</a> library.</p>
