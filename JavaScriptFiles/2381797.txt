Javascript: How to trigger an &quot;onchange&quot; event while the text element still has focus?
<p>As far as I understand, the "onchange" event of a text input element is only fired when two conditions are true:</p> <ul> <li>The text has changed.</li> <li>The field no longer has focus.</li> </ul> <p>So when you click off, it fires the event. How can I fire an event when the text has changed, but the field still has focus?</p>
<p>you have access to the <code>keypress</code>, <code>keyup</code>, and <code>keydown</code> events; <a href="http://www.quirksmode.org/js/keys.html" rel="nofollow noreferrer">the details</a> of when those fire can be found at Quirksmode.</p>
<p>Reliably? You can't, yet.</p> <p>You can catch the majority of changes by firing your update checker <code>onkeyup</code> as well as <code>onchange</code>. However whilst this picks up simple keyboard interactions, it fails to trigger on other events like cut-and-paste (there is <code>onpaste</code> in some browsers, but you can't rely on it), drag-and-drop, undo-redo and spellchecker changes.</p> <p>HTML5 proposes <code>oninput</code> to solve this, but the implementation isn't there yet. If you really want to spot all input changes today you will have to <code>setInterval</code> a function that keeps checking the input's value to see if it has changed.</p>
