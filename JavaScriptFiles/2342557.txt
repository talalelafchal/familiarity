Javascript: date depending on the field specification order? Really?
<p>Why on earth does this code:</p> <pre><code>var a = new Date(); var b = new Date(); a.setDate(31); a.setMonth(11); a.setFullYear(2009); b.setFullYear(2009); b.setMonth(11); b.setDate(31); </code></pre> <p>ouputs correctly 31 december 2009 for b and 3 december 2009 :-O for a? Not in browser MyHorribleScrap version 6.6.6 but BOTH on FF 3.6 AND IE 8.06.6001</p>
<p>That's why is recommended to use the <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en/Core_JavaScript_1.5_Reference/Objects/Date" rel="nofollow noreferrer"><code>Date</code></a> constructor with arguments.</p> <p>What is happening is when you instantiate the <code>Date</code> object, it gets the current date (today, February 26), and February has only 28 days, when you set the date by <code>setDate(31)</code>, it jumps to the March 3.</p> <p>The recommended way:</p> <pre><code>var a = new Date(2009, 11, 31); // new Date(year, month, date [, hour, minute, second, millisecond ]); </code></pre>
<p>i was practicly writing TimÂ´s answer =/</p> <p>First set the year(because it could be a leap year) , then the month, and finally de date, but the best practice is using the constructor Date(year,month,date) but not always want to do that way.</p>
