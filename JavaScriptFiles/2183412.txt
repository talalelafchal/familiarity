Check which JavaScript function is run after clicking button in Internet Explorer
<p>Is there any way or tools I can check which <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JavaScript" rel="nofollow noreferrer">JavaScript</a> function is run after clicking a button in Internet Explorer?</p>
<p>No, unless it is a JavaScript URL in a href, or a hard-coded onclick (or similar). There is no way to enumerate event listeners.</p>
<p>Try the IE8 Script Debugger (under Developer tools (F12)). The Developer Tools have several tabs, one of them is "Script". There, you need to use "start debugging" button (it changes to "stop debugging", as seen in screenshot), and then look for a button with the "pause" (<code>||</code>) symbol on the same toolbar. Note that the </p> <p><img src="http://so.piskvor.org/2183412/sc-1.png" alt="activating Developer Tools"> <img src="http://so.piskvor.org/2183412/sc-2.png" alt="break all button"></p> <p>It allows you to set "break on next instruction"; do that and the debugger will open on the next line of JS to be executed. If you step through all the event handlers for the button, you'll see what is called there.</p> <p>If you have some control over the page, you may want to disable the mouseover and similar handlers, as those will also trigger the debugger.</p>
