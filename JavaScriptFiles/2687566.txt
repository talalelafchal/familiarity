Learning JavaScript in one weekend?
<p>Similar to <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/2682561/learning-python-in-one-weekend">this question</a>, I am wondering if experienced JavaScript developers have any websites they use with examples to get the basics of JavaScript down in 24/28 hours? I have looked at Douglas Crockford's Google Tech Talk and I bought the book "Javascript: The Good Parts", but I haven't had time to read it. </p>
<p>If you are starting with <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/2687566/learning-javascript-in-one-weekend/2687581#2687581">the W3Schools tutorial</a>, you should get through that in just a couple of hours, at most. In the remaining time I would suggest watching the video lectures listed in the following blog article:</p> <ul> <li><a href="http://www.catonmat.net/blog/learning-javascript-programming-language-through-video-lectures" rel="nofollow noreferrer">Learning JavaScript Programming Language through Video Lectures</a> by Peteris Krumins</li> </ul> <p>The author of that blog article wrote very detailed points on each video talk, so you can get a very clear idea of what will be discussed. The talks are given by <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Douglas_Crockford" rel="nofollow noreferrer">Douglas Crockford</a>, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Resig" rel="nofollow noreferrer">John Resig</a> and <a href="http://www.nczonline.net/" rel="nofollow noreferrer">Nicholas Zakas</a> - all significant figures in the JavaScript world. These should take quite a big chunk from your weekend, but they should serve as a very sound introduction for when you go through "<a href="http://books.google.com/books?id=PXa2bby0oQ0C&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=javascript+the+good+parts&amp;ei=PqLPS6r3No3KzgT_taX1CQ&amp;cd=1" rel="nofollow noreferrer">The Good Parts</a>" book.</p> <p>JavaScript is a very expressive language, and I hope learning it will be fun. You can really sense the enthusiasm of the speakers in the above talks when they describe some of the good features of the language, such as <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Closure_(computer_science)" rel="nofollow noreferrer">closures</a> and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/First-class_function" rel="nofollow noreferrer">first-class functions</a>. Enjoy!</p>
<p>If you're learning Javascript it's worth checking out <a href="http://jquery.com" rel="nofollow noreferrer">jQuery</a> and <a href="http://www.prototypejs.org" rel="nofollow noreferrer">Prototype</a> as they will help a lot with writing cross browser Javascript as well as some great resource for performing some of the trickier tasks in JS like animation, etc. </p>
<p>i second the <a href="http://www.w3schools.com" rel="nofollow noreferrer">W3Schools</a> reference. I also like the <a href="http://rads.stackoverflow.com/amzn/click/0672328801" rel="nofollow noreferrer">Javascript Phrasebook</a>, it's got real world examples with brief explanations of each one. Doesn't go into the history or theory of the language, which may be too much reading if you want to stuff as much as possible into one weekend.</p>
<p>Here is my list of <em>really</em> good resources to learn the language:</p> <ul> <li><a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en/core_javascript_1.5_guide" rel="nofollow noreferrer">Mozilla Developer Center: Core JavaScript 1.5 Guide</a></li> <li><a href="http://eloquentjavascript.net/" rel="nofollow noreferrer">Eloquent JavaScript</a> (Interactive tutorial)</li> <li><a href="http://ejohn.org/apps/learn/" rel="nofollow noreferrer">Learning Advanced JavaScript</a> (Interactive tutorial)</li> <li><a href="http://www.quirksmode.org/" rel="nofollow noreferrer">QuirksMode</a> (The prime source for browser compatibility information)</li> <li><a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en/A_re-introduction_to_JavaScript" rel="nofollow noreferrer">A re-introduction to JavaScript</a> (Great article)</li> <li><a href="https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL7664379246A246CB" rel="nofollow noreferrer">Douglas Crockford Video Series</a></li> <li><a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en/Introduction_to_Object-Oriented_JavaScript" rel="nofollow noreferrer">Introduction to Object Oriented JavaScript</a></li> <li><a href="http://www.3site.eu/doc/" rel="nofollow noreferrer">JavaScript Prototypal Inheritance</a></li> <li><a href="http://www.ecma-international.org/publications/standards/Ecma-262.htm" rel="nofollow noreferrer">ECMAScript Language Specification</a></li> </ul> <p>Tools:</p> <ul> <li>A debugger <ul> <li><a href="http://getfirebug.com" rel="nofollow noreferrer">Firebug</a> for Firefox</li> <li><a href="http://www.opera.com/dragonfly/" rel="nofollow noreferrer">Dragonfly</a> for Opera</li> <li><a href="http://www.apple.com/safari/features.html" rel="nofollow noreferrer">Developer tools</a> (Safari / WebKit)</li> <li><a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/dd565628%28VS.85%29.aspx" rel="nofollow noreferrer">IE8 Developer Tools</a></li> </ul></li> </ul>
<p>I was more or less in your situation. What I did was </p> <ul> <li><p>I read "javascript, the good parts". It's a good book, but don't take it literally. For example, its use of objects, completely neglecting the new operator and the native object instantiation mechanism is frankly excessive. Hence, learn the prototype-based mechanism well.</p></li> <li><p>take jQuery and learn it by using. Remember that jQuery is a great library to manipulate the web page DOM. add nodes, remove nodes, and much more. jQuery abstracts many browser dependent operations, so you don't go mad with browser incompatibilities.</p></li> <li><p>tinker and when you find yourself in a troublesome spot, use FireBug to find the trouble. Make smaller examples, be very wary of variables introduced without the <code>var</code> keyword, and always keep into account that <code>this</code> refers to the object owning a given routine, and this could be an unexpected one.</p></li> </ul> <p>Javascript (and JS on the DOM) is a nice language, but its logic can be baffling sometimes. Don't give up. Once you get to understand how it works, it's rather intuitive.</p>
<p>The part of your question that matters here is </p> <blockquote> <p>[how do] experienced Javascript developers ... get the basics of Javascript down in 24/28 hours</p> </blockquote> <p>Experience is not something that you can get in one night, one week, one month, or one year. Experience is something that you acquire over the course of years of hard work &mdash; encountering bugs, learning best practices, re-writing code that you wrote four years before and asking yourself, "why did I do this", optimizing for far-less-than-perfect environments ...</p> <p>That being said, if you have only one night to learn enough to make you dangerous, then start at the bottom and work your way up. Daniel Vassallo has given you one very nice link already, and more than one person has suggested W3Schools for a quick overview of both Javascript and the DOM. </p> <p>But don't start with any of that. Instead, start by determining, as well as you can, what it is you want to be able to do with Javascript tomorrow. To do that you need to ask yourself two simple questions.</p> <p><strong>What is your level of programing expertise?</strong> Can you code complex algorithms in <code>C</code> and <code>C++</code> with the occasionally foray into some variant of assembler? Have you ever worked on a decently large project in a slightly "higher level" language like <code>C#</code> or <code>Java</code>? Do you know at least one scripting language decently? Or do the phrases "functional programing", "class-based inheritance" and "bubble sort" mean nothing to you right off the bat? If you are in any of the first three categories, a little time with a few of the <strong><a href="http://javascript.crockford.com/prototypal.html" rel="nofollow noreferrer">better</a> <a href="http://javascript.crockford.com/little.html" rel="nofollow noreferrer">tutorials</a> <a href="http://perfectionkills.com/javascript-quiz/" rel="nofollow noreferrer">on</a> <a href="http://www.jibbering.com/faq/faq_notes/closures.html" rel="nofollow noreferrer">the</a> <a href="http://ejohn.org/apps/learn/" rel="nofollow noreferrer">Internet</a></strong>, and maybe a quick look at a Stackoverflow <strong><a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/61088/hidden-features-of-javascript">question</a> <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/2628672/what-every-javascript-programmer-should-know">or</a> <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/2687566/learning-javascript-in-one-weekend/2687693#2687693">two</a></strong> should have you up and running in no time. If you are in the last category, you might do well to start off with the basics of programing in general. No matter what you are going to need an environment in which to learn. Which brings us to the second question ...</p> <p><strong>What is your platform?</strong> Are you planning on doing some server-side programing with <a href="http://nodejs.org/" rel="nofollow noreferrer"><code>node.js</code></a>? Maybe you planning on developing some utility in a <a href="http://www.mozilla.org/rhino/" rel="nofollow noreferrer"><code>Rhino</code></a> or <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/yek4tbz0(VS.85).aspx" rel="nofollow noreferrer"><code>JScript</code></a> environment? If either of these situations are the case then reading the documentation for the platform you will be developing on will stand you in much better stead than reading up on the DOM. If, on the other hand you are planning on developing for the web, then you cannot do much better than to grab <a href="http://www.mozilla.com/en-US/firefox/firefox.html" rel="nofollow noreferrer">Firefox</a> with the <a href="http://getfirebug.com/" rel="nofollow noreferrer">Firebug</a> extension and start by building a simplified version of what you are going to be working on tomorrow.</p> <p>And if none of this is in any way helpful to you then hopefully by the time you have finished reading it, someone else will have answered the question in a far more suitable manner ... that's the beauty of Stackoverflow.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.codecademy.com" rel="nofollow">codecademy</a> is really excellent site to learn not only javascript but HTML and css and some more stuffs. This site is a bit different than others. because you will learn stuffs in this site interactively.</p>
