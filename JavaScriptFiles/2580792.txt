Using JavaScript how do I pass a value from a parent form to a child form?
<p>I have tried numerous things to no avail. What I am trying to do sounds simple...ASP.NET 2.0. A person enters data in 1 field. I then want them to click a button, this opens a form using window.open whereby the data they entered should be display. </p> <p>All the examples I find are either incomplete or go from child to parent instead of parent to child.</p>
<p>append this info to the querystring in your window.open logic then pull that data out of the querystring when the child page loads via javascript or serverside scripting.</p> <p>jquery querystring plugin<br /> <a href="http://plugins.jquery.com/project/query-object" rel="nofollow noreferrer">http://plugins.jquery.com/project/query-object</a></p>
