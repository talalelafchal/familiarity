javascript call url from different domain
<p>I want to post some data via javascript to another domain. Something like:</p> <pre><code>http://www.othersite.com/submitfunnyname?name=blah </code></pre> <p>The other site (othersite.com) has a REST interface that you can call (well actually this is a get example) to submit a funny name to them.</p> <p>Can I do this already with javascript? I'm a little confused on this - I know if that service wants to return some data, I'd need to use something like JSON-P - even though here I'm submitting some data, I guess the service will return some message structure letting me know the result, so it would have to be JSON-P, right?</p> <p>Thanks</p>
<p>You can either use JSON-P if the site supports it, or you can use your web server as a proxy - by making requests to your server, which will in turn use a library such as cURL to make the actual request to the remote site.</p>
<p>Not a particular expert in JavaScript, but isn't this an example of "cross-site scripting", which is not allowed due to possible security threats?</p> <p>I believe you need to have all HTTP calls being made to the same server domain as the page. You could have a handler on your own site pass the information on to the othersite.com.</p>
