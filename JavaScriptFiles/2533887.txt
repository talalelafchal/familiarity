How to change a div's innerHTML after redirecting?
<p>I am trying to change the innerHTML of a div on the page that I am loading.</p> <p>This is my JavaScript code:</p> <pre><code>function redirect(titleName){ window.location = "pageToLoad.php"; document.getElementById("title").innerHTML = titleName; } </code></pre> <p>It doesn't seem to be working, please help me!!</p>
<p>The execution life of a script extends only for as long as the page it is running in lives.</p> <p>If you want to access the DOM of one document from a script running in another, then the other page has to hang around. This means you either have to use frames or open popups.</p> <p>Neither of these is a good idea. You should rethink what you are trying to achieve and find a better approach (which will probably be "Just change the title of the page you are linking to in the source of that page").</p>
