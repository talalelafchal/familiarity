GET in a For Loop does just one execution
<p>Am trying to make a get request from javascript, with a function called geturl. So if i prepare my querys and add it in to an array, and looping throw that executes just one request. how can do that without a for loop? perhaps doing something with the array? </p> <pre><code>for (var i=0; i&lt;urls.length; i++) { url[i] = urls[i].value; } geturl(url); </code></pre>
<p>if you are using a javascript framework you could do something along the lines of:</p> <pre><code>var collection; $(urls).each(function(v){//add to collection}); geturl(collection); </code></pre> <p><a href="http://api.jquery.com/jQuery.each/" rel="nofollow noreferrer">jQuery each documentation</a></p>
<p>You could use a framework such as prototype or jQuery that give you an <code>each()</code> method to use on the array, <em>but</em> internally it would likely just use a for loop anyway, so there's not really much point to it.</p> <p>Alternatively, if this is because you are using the for loop all over the place and want to have reusable code instead, why not attach a <code>buildUrl</code> method to your <code>urls</code> object (which loops internally, and returns your <code>url</code> array)</p> <p>Or modify <code>geturl()</code> so it looks at the <code>.value</code> property of the argument rather than expecting each element of <code>url[]</code> to be a string, then pass <code>urls[]</code> in to <code>geturl</code> (eg <code>geturl(urls);</code> rather than passing in the array of string <code>url</code></p>
<p>A total stab in the dark, if the question is </p> <blockquote> <p>Why does geturl only get called once?</p> </blockquote> <p>Then the answer could be:-</p> <pre><code>for (var i=0; i&lt;urls.length; i++) { url[i] = urls[i].value; geturl(url[i]); } </code></pre> <p>However it is not apparent!</p>
