How to implement exact full-screen in javascript?
<p>I tried <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/1125084/how-to-make-in-javascript-full-screen-windows-stretching-all-over-the-screen/1125113#1125113">How to make in Javascript full screen windows (stretching all over the screen)</a>,</p> <p>but it's not working.</p> <p><strong>EDIT</strong></p> <p>I mean it should fill all of my computer by full-screen.</p>
<p>Like this:</p> <pre><code>alert("Please press F11"); </code></pre> <p>There's no way to make an existing window completely fullscreen in Javascript.</p> <p>The closest you can get is to open a popup window and pray that it doesn't get blocked by popup blockers, like this:</p> <pre><code>open("http://google.com", null, "height=" + screen.availHeight + ",width=" + screen.availWidth + ",status=no,toolbar=no,menubar=no,location=no") </code></pre>
