A plug in to watch the javascript functions is runing in that certain time
<p>Like in fiddler you can watch the logs between client and server. Like fiddler; which logs all HTTP(S) traffic between your computer and the Internet. I want to inspect all traffic happening on the client side JavaScript that runs on a page.</p> <p>Best wishes bk</p>
<p>You can do this best using <a href="http://getfirebug.com/" rel="nofollow noreferrer">Firebug</a> for Firefox :)</p> <p>When you open firebug, open the <strong>net</strong> panel and you can see all traffic the browser's dealing with. If you want just the AJAX requests, there's a bar under the main tabs, select <strong>XHR</strong>.</p> <p>There's more info available on the <a href="http://getfirebug.com/network" rel="nofollow noreferrer">net section of the firebug site</a>.</p> <p>If I misunderstood the question and you want to see all javascript activity, then Firebug does this as well, just open the <strong>Console</strong> panel and click <strong>profile</strong>, this will let you see what's happening on the client with all javascript.</p> <p>As an aside, if you need an IE specific tool, I'd <em>really</em> recommend <a href="http://ajax.dynatrace.com/" rel="nofollow noreferrer">dynaTrace AJAX Edition</a> (also free!). It's a very in-depth profiler specifically tailored for IE.</p>
