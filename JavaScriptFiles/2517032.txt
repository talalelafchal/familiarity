Advantages of using [] over new Array() in JavaScript
<p>What are the advantages of using </p> <pre><code>var foo = []; </code></pre> <p>over using</p> <pre><code>var bar = new Array(); </code></pre> <p>i've been told to use [] over new Array() but never with much explanation</p>
<p>It's the same thing. The only reason to use <code>[]</code> over <code>new Array()</code> is that it's shorter.</p>
<ul> <li>shorter</li> <li>arguments of Array are confusing (e.g. <code>new Array(10)</code> and <code>new Array("10")</code> are quite different)</li> </ul>
<p>shorter and cleaner. Should use {} to create objects as well.</p>
<p>Both can be used as good. This discussion/confusion has started since Javascript guru <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Douglas_Crockford" rel="nofollow noreferrer">Douglas Crockford</a> told that <a href="http://yuiblog.com/blog/2006/11/13/javascript-we-hardly-new-ya/" rel="nofollow noreferrer">the <code>new</code> keyword is considered harmful</a>. Since then it was considered "good practice/technique" to leave out the <code>new</code> keyword to avoid unexpected results/behaviour. Also see this <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/383402/is-javascript-s-new-keyword-considered-harmful">Stackoverflow topic</a>.</p>
<p>The main reason to use <code>[]</code> as opposed to <code>new Array()</code> is the arguments you pass. When you use <code>new Array(10)</code>, you create an empty array with 10 elements, but when you use <code>[10]</code>, you create an array with one element who's value is <code>10</code>. Since this is generally the information most programmers want to pass to an array (as arrays are dynamic in Javascript), this is generally considered the best practice. Also <code>new Array(10,20)</code> works differently than <code>new Array(10)</code>. In this case you have the same effect as <code>[10,20]</code> which is to create an array with 2 elements, 10 and 20. Since this is... strange at best... it's easy to accidentally create an empty array by passing <code>new Array()</code> only one value. <code>[]</code> always has the same effect, so I'd also recommend sticking with it.</p>
<p>It scores you less symbols in code golf.</p>
<p>Three reasons (the first two expanded upon in other answers):</p> <ol> <li>Shorter;</li> <li>Allows creation of arrays with one element, as detailed in Chibu's answer;</li> <li>Works even in the unlikely event of the <code>Array</code> constructor having been overwritten.</li> </ol> <p>Non-reasons:</p> <ol> <li>Avoidance of the <code>new</code> operator. Don't be afraid of <code>new</code> just because Douglas Crockford was once bitten by it. It's extremely useful.</li> </ol>
