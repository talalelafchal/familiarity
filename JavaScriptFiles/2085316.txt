Why do I see a dollar sign before some constructors in JavaScript?
<p>In JQuery and other libraries I keep seeing a dollar sign $ before constructors. </p> <p>What is the significance of that symbol?</p>
<p>In JavaScript identifier can start with _ OR $ or Character. And $ is valid to be used in identifiers. In the JavaScript frameworks(like JQuery) $ is very nicely used. However its always suggested as good practice not to user the $ for identifiers.</p>
<p>The $ sign does not have any special meaning in JavaScript, unlike languages like Perl or PHP, where it's used to indicate that something is a variable. So when you see something like <code>var $foo</code> it's is only a variable whose name happens to start with dollar.</p> <p>You see a lots of dollars out there because many popular JavaScript libraries have chosen a single $ as a name for their main object. It's short and handy to have a function you can call with <code>$()</code>. As a consequence of this, some programmers use a naming convention for their own variables: they use $ as a prefix if the variable is an instance of the framework object. That makes it easy to spot visually if a variable is an scalar or an object.</p> <p>An example in jQuery:</p> <pre><code>var txt = "This a regular text"; var links = document.getElementsByTagName("a"); // Array of DOM nodes var $links = $("a"); // jQuery object </code></pre>
<p><code>$</code> is a valid variable/function identifier in Javascript. It is used in frameworks such as jQuery.</p>
