API to get hostname from Jscript
<p>I am not sure why my previous post was not listed. Lets see if this one gets listed. I have a stand alone jScript which passes parameters to a C# program. I have to pass hostname to the C# program. Is there an api which I can use to get hostname in the jScript if not can I do it using the 'hostname' system command?</p> <p>Thanks in Advance. Sam</p>
<p>Since you're using JScript I assume you're running under Windows. You can get the current computer's name from the environment:</p> <pre><code>var env, computerName; env = new ActiveXObject("WScript.Shell").Environment("Process"); computerName = env("COMPUTERNAME"); </code></pre> <p>...if that's what you mean by hostname. More on environments (there are more than one available, above I picked the process's environment) <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/fd7hxfdd(v=VS.85).aspx" rel="nofollow noreferrer">here</a>.</p>
