Javascript - access object member when identifier string is stored in a var
<p>I've got a pretty simple question (and tentative answers), I just want to see if maybe there is a better answer out there.</p> <p>How can you access an object member in javascript when the member identifier is stored in another variable? Example:</p> <pre><code>state = 'sync'; messages = { 'sync': 'asdf', 'ready': 'asdf', 'complete': 'asdf' }; </code></pre> <p>Possibilities: 1. message = <code>eval('messages.' + state);</code></p> <ol start="2"> <li>turn message into a hash (in prototype or jquery--not sure about jquery) and access through the framework's method</li> </ol> <p>What other ways are there? Anything cleaner? In php it would be simple <code>$message = $messages-&gt;$sync</code>.</p> <p>I'm sure this question has been answered many times but it is tough to search for... all I get are eval responses when I search for 'variable variables'</p> <p>Thanks</p>
<pre><code>var message = messages[state]; </code></pre> <p>Every object in JavaScript is not only an object in the more usual sense, but it is also a dictionary populated by its members.</p>
