Is there any way to copy contents (text) of a pop up window from a web page,automatically in an Excel cell?
<p>There is a web page with products(description and prices).If someone wants more details has to click on a row in order to open a pop up window with more details about the certain product.Is there any way to automatically copy the contents of the pop up window into a cell next to the cells i get the data from my web query? the pop up window is like(....<a href="http://www.apage.com/product_info.asp?node_serial=&amp;node_id=&amp;ITEMID=0011262" rel="nofollow noreferrer">http://www.apage.com/product_info.asp?node_serial=&amp;node_id=&amp;ITEMID=0011262</a>) thanks a lot in advance </p>
<p>I doubt very much that javascript (your tag) can access both the browser and Excel without user intervention, that would thoroughly break security.</p>
<p>If you know what the url is, I'm <em>fairly sure</em> in Excel you can do:</p> <blockquote> <p>File > Open > FileType=HTML > {paste URL}</p> </blockquote> <p>If you don't have the URL, right click the popup, choose properties, then highlight the URL (it is selectable)</p> <p>Windows will fetch the file for you and dump the HTML into a new spreadsheet.</p> <p>Note, you will get all the junk that the page contains too, not just the data. If you want an elaborate system, you're likely going to need a screen scraping application or use something like PHP's curl to pull data out of a URL.</p>
