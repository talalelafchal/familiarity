document.write('&lt;scr' + 'ipt src= vs &lt;script src=
<p>Apart from allowing you insert js variables into a script tag when written like <code>document.write('&lt;scr' + 'ipt src=</code> what are the pros/cons of this vs a normal <code>&lt;script src=&gt;</code> tag?</p> <p>I'm mainly asking with regard to speed but interested in the whole story.</p> <p>Thanks Denis</p>
<p>Other than those? There aren't any.</p> <p>(Incidentally, splitting a script tag in a JS string into a pair of concatenated strings is pointless bloat)</p>
<p>There is no need for <code>'&lt;scr'+'ipt'</code>. There is need for <code>'&lt;\/scr'+'ipt&gt;'</code>. Because HTML interpreter has no need to understand Javascript, so it will treat everything between <code>&lt;script&gt;...&lt;/script&gt;</code> as the text, and won't care <code>var a='&lt;/script&gt;';</code> is a string literal Javascript, it will consider it the closing tag for <code>&lt;script&gt;</code> and regard the remainder of the script text as plain (erroneous) HTML.</p> <p>edit: corrected per David's suggestion</p>
<p>I assume this is to gain non blocking javascript loading.</p> <p>For this i suggest looking at Steve Souders posts about the subject. <a href="http://www.stevesouders.com/blog/2009/04/27/loading-scripts-without-blocking/" rel="nofollow noreferrer">http://www.stevesouders.com/blog/2009/04/27/loading-scripts-without-blocking/</a></p> <p>The LABjs library solves this in a pretty nifty way. <a href="http://labjs.com/" rel="nofollow noreferrer">http://labjs.com/</a></p> <p>Also it seems newer browsers are beginning to load things parallel by default <a href="http://www.stevesouders.com/blog/2010/02/07/browser-script-loading-roundup/" rel="nofollow noreferrer">http://www.stevesouders.com/blog/2010/02/07/browser-script-loading-roundup/</a></p>
