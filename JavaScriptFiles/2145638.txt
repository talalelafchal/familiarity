javascript semantics
<p>I am trying upgrade my javascript programming skills ( or lets say my programming skills period : ) )</p> <p>so I am trying to understand some semantics :</p> <p>in the first line what does the "?" mean as well as the minus sign in "-distance"</p> <p>in the second line what does '+=' or '-=" mean?</p> <pre><code> el.css(ref, motion == 'pos' ? -distance : distance) animation[ref] = (mode == 'show' ? (motion == 'pos' ? '+=' : '-=') : (motion == 'pos' ? '-=' : '+=')) + distance; </code></pre> <p>thank you</p>
<p>? is the ternary operator</p> <p>it equals</p> <pre><code>if( motion == 'pos' ) { return -distance; } else { return distance; } // - is just negating the distance value </code></pre>
<p><code>a ? b : c</code> means "<code>b</code> if <code>a</code> is true, <code>c</code> otherwise".</p> <p><code>-a</code> means <code>a</code>, negated.</p> <p><code>a -= b</code> and <code>a += b</code> mean <code>a = a - b</code> and <code>a = a + b</code> respectively. However, in your example these operators aren't actually present in the code, they are just text strings the code is manipulating.</p>
<ol> <li><code>(a ? b : c)</code> means "return <code>b</code> if <code>a</code> is true, and return <code>c</code> if <code>a</code> is false."</li> <li>The minus sign means negation.</li> <li>The <code>'+='</code> and <code>'-='</code> are simply strings.</li> </ol>
<p>What you call 'semantics' is actually programming language syntax. It's very basic knowledge that can be acquired easily by googling a bit or looking at Wikipedia.</p> <p>Here's the JavaScript article on Wikipedia, and here's the answers on your <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JavaScript_syntax#Conditional_operator" rel="nofollow noreferrer">first (conditional operator section)</a>, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JavaScript_syntax#Arithmetic" rel="nofollow noreferrer">second (Arithmetic)</a> and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JavaScript_syntax#Assignment" rel="nofollow noreferrer">third (Assignment)</a> questions within the same article. RTFM please.</p>
<p>Here is a link that will answer the ? question (? is a shorthand evaluation operation). <a href="http://www.w3schools.com/JS/js_comparisons.asp" rel="nofollow noreferrer">http://www.w3schools.com/JS/js_comparisons.asp</a></p> <p>+= would be used to increment a value (also shorthand) e.g. </p> <pre><code>i = i + 1; is the same as i += 1; </code></pre> <p>the same applies to -=</p>
