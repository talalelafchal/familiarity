Is there any non-web application of JavaScript?
<p>As far as I know, JavaScript is a general purpose language but mostly it is used for Web Applications.</p> <p>I am curious to know whether anyone is using JavaScript for non-Web apps. Also, are there any tools available for non-Web application development?</p>
<p>Yes, you have Javascript for example in <a href="http://www.adobe.com/devnet/acrobat/javascript.html" rel="nofollow noreferrer">Adobe Acrobat</a> to customize PDF Files.</p> <p>They are used in server-side projects too like Jaxer, a <a href="http://www.jaxer.org/" rel="nofollow noreferrer">Javascript Server</a>.</p>
<p>Sure! Since the newer javascript engines (like <a href="http://code.google.com/p/v8/" rel="nofollow noreferrer">V8</a>, <a href="http://www.mozilla.org/rhino/" rel="nofollow noreferrer">Rhino</a> and <a href="http://www.mozilla.org/js/spidermonkey/" rel="nofollow noreferrer">SpiderMonkey</a>) have been around there's been work on 'Server-Side JS' (which can also be used just as regular shell apps, of course).</p> <p>My 2 favorites are <a href="http://narwhaljs.org/" rel="nofollow noreferrer">Narwhal</a> and <a href="http://nodejs.org" rel="nofollow noreferrer">NodeJS</a>.</p> <p>As far as 'tools' I'd go with the old stand-by's vim and bash :)</p>
<p>Well, someone did write a <a href="http://www.masswerk.at/jsuix/" rel="nofollow noreferrer">Javascript OS</a> (although it runs in the browser... but still, not your ordinary webapp).</p>
<p>javascript can be used as a general purpose language, for instance you can write apps in <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/72bd815a%28VS.71%29.aspx" rel="nofollow noreferrer">JScript.NET</a> on the .NET platform (though JScript isn't completely compatible with the javascript spec).</p> <p>You can find some more uses outside of web applications here:</p> <p><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JavaScript#Uses_outside_web_pages" rel="nofollow noreferrer">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JavaScript#Uses_outside_web_pages</a></p>
<p>JavaScript has been in use for a while outside of web applications. You can even obtain a parser for javascript and add it to your application if you want. Then you an add custom functions to the javascript engine and allow your users to use a scripting language from within your application.</p>
<p>Rhino is a JavaScript implementation written in Java that is not coupled to a browser: <a href="http://www.mozilla.org/rhino/" rel="nofollow noreferrer">http://www.mozilla.org/rhino/</a></p> <p>You could use it to build something server side.</p>
<p>MongoDB (from "humongous") is a scalable, high-performance, open source, schema-free, document-oriented database. You interact with it via JavaScript. Documents are JSON blobs.</p>
<p>There's a reasonable list <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JavaScript#Uses_outside_web_pages" rel="nofollow noreferrer">here</a>: for example, it points out that Javascript can be (and is;-) used for the purpose of scripting such non-web apps as Photoshop and OpenOffice.org. On the same wikipedia page you'll find pointers to several stand-alone Javascript interpreters (i.e., ones that are not part of web browsers) and specs for making e.g. your Java non-web apps more easily scriptable by Javascript (via a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rhino_(JavaScript_engine)" rel="nofollow noreferrer">Rhino</a>-derived stand-alone interpreter).</p>
<p>htlmwithjavascript.hta (HTML Applications) files can be run on Windows to do scripting with the convienence of HTML formatiing. The Windows scripting engine also supports jscript.</p>
<p>Dashboard Widgets in Mac OS X?</p>
<p>You can create local desktop and mobile applications using JavaScript with a number of Web Runtime platforms. They include:</p> <ul> <li><a href="http://www.appcelerator.com/" rel="nofollow noreferrer">Appcelerator Titanium</a> (Desktop &amp; Mobile)</li> <li><a href="http://www.adobe.com/products/air/develop/ajax/" rel="nofollow noreferrer">Adobe AIR</a> (Desktop)</li> <li><a href="http://developer.palm.com/" rel="nofollow noreferrer">Palm webOS</a> (Mobile)</li> <li><a href="http://phonegap.com/" rel="nofollow noreferrer">PhoneGap</a> (Mobile)</li> </ul>
<p>You can use JavaScript in the Scripter MIDI effects plugin of Apple's Logic Pro X to create custom MIDI plugins.</p>
