How the addon of the firefox is accessing the file sytem
<p>firefox wont allow the javascript to save a file in client machine is the browser security policy </p> <p><a href="https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/1046" rel="nofollow noreferrer">https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/1046</a></p> <p>the above linked addon can save a file then why cant we save a file in the filesystem using javascript </p>
<p>Code that is part of an extension the user explicitly chose to install is trusted more than code running on a page the user happens to visit. Thus, Firefox allows extension code this functionality (accessing the filesystem), but does not allow code running in a webpage to do this.</p> <p>This makes sense: it's much easier for an attacker to get a user to accidentally visit his malicious page and run it's javascript (with invisible iframes, for example), than it is for an attacker to get the user to install a malicious extension. Additionally, Mozilla code reviews every extension on their website to make sure they aren't malicious.</p> <p>I should also note that extensions don't have to be written in Javascript. Many of them are written in native code (C++ usually), and there are XPCOM (one of the ways extensions interface with the browser) bindings for other languages as well (Python, for example).</p>
<p>Javascript is executed from the webpages you visit ; and, generally speaking, you cannot trust each and every webpage you visit -- which is why there are such security measures.</p> <p><br> For the extensions, on the other hand :</p> <ul> <li><strong>You</strong> decide which extension has the right to run on your system, as you are the one installing them <ul> <li>And installing an extension means you trust it.</li> </ul></li> <li>Are tested / reviewed by the team of AMO <em>(correct me if I'm wrong ?)</em></li> </ul>
<p>Add-ons aren't subject to the security restrictions, because the user explicitly installed them (e.g., indicated trust). See the <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en/Extensions" rel="nofollow noreferrer">extensions documentation</a> for details. This is very different from JavaScript running on a web page, which the user hasn't indicated they trust.</p>
