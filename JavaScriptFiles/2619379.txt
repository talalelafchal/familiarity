How do I enable enter key submit?
<p>So two questions here: If I use <code>&lt;input type="button" onclick="validate()"&gt;</code> then the enter key wouldn't work. However, I can use <code>type="submit"</code> but how would I invoke <code>validate()</code>? </p>
<p>You can have the form validate on submit, which is better anyways: </p> <pre><code>&lt;form ... onsubmit="return validate()"&gt; &lt;input type="submit" /&gt; &lt;/form&gt; </code></pre> <p>You can return <code>false</code> from your validation function to prevent the form from submitting. The form will validate regardless of whether it's submitted via the return key or the button being clicked.</p>
