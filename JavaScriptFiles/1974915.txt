Resources about the Javascript object model?
<p>I am looking for a good resource (comprehensive yet terse) that explains the Javascript object model: prototype, constructor, Function, Object, etc.</p> <p>Surprisingly there aren't many resources out there that discuss this issue. The best I found, so far, is this: <a href="http://www.mollypages.org/misc/js.mp" rel="nofollow noreferrer">http://www.mollypages.org/misc/js.mp</a></p> <p>Anyone familiar with other (hopefully better) explanations?</p>

<p>I'm not exactly sure what you mean by Javascript object model, but if it's <strong>inheritance</strong> you're after, here's a <a href="http://joost.zeekat.nl/constructors-considered-mildly-confusing.html" rel="nofollow noreferrer">nice overview</a> by Joost Diepenmaat, which includes few helpful diagrams. There's also a <a href="http://www.3site.eu/doc/" rel="nofollow noreferrer">decent article</a> on this subject by Andrea Giammarchi.</p>
<p>I rate book "Javascript:The Good Parts" by douglas Crockford as one of the best for understanding Javascript model and its nuances.</p> <p>Online you may find this helpful too. <a href="http://kevlindev.com/tutorials/javascript/inheritance/index.htm" rel="nofollow noreferrer">http://kevlindev.com/tutorials/javascript/inheritance/index.htm</a> <a href="http://www.packtpub.com/article/using-prototype-property-in-javascript" rel="nofollow noreferrer">http://www.packtpub.com/article/using-prototype-property-in-javascript</a></p> <p>Hope it helps.</p>
