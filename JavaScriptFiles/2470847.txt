Javascript Input type
<p>In javascript we use input type = file .. to open up a file browser pop-up .. is there a way to limit access to folders .. I want to select a folder then ftp all the files in the folder .. so i need access upto only the folder level and not file level .. i guess it would be tedious to go an manually select every file from the folder and then ftp .. is there a way to do that.. Also, how can i set the file-browser pop-up window path to a default one ? </p>
<p>You need to take advantage of Flash or similar to enabled extended file upload options.</p> <p>e.g. <a href="http://www.swfupload.org/project" rel="nofollow noreferrer">SWFUpload</a> will allow you to filter out:</p> <ul> <li>file types: *.gif, *.doc, *.zip etc.</li> <li>file size: max etc.</li> <li>multiple files</li> </ul> <p>etc.</p>
<p>You can not do that in standard JavaScript - it's a functionality that is browser dependent.</p> <p>It may be exposed via Flash or some other custom browser plugin.</p>
