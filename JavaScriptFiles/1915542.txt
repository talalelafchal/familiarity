Javascript window.scrollBy not working on particular page
<p>window.scrollBy is not working on the following page <a href="http://www.resident.co.il/aspx/places.aspx?t=4&amp;a=1" rel="nofollow noreferrer">http://www.resident.co.il/aspx/places.aspx?t=4&amp;a=1</a></p> <p>Any idea what can be the problem ? </p>
<p>Entering <code>javascript:window.scrollBy(0,10)</code> in the address bar scrolls the window fine for me. I can't see any call to <code>window.scrollBy</code> in the page or attached scripts so I don't know where any failed attempt to scroll might be.</p> <p>Edit re comment: aahhh, I see. You can only scroll it a little bit, because the document is only ever a little bit taller than the viewport. This is because of the:</p> <pre><code>position: absolute; width: 100%; height :100%; overflow: auto; </code></pre> <p>on the wrapper div. You would have to scroll this div, not the window itself, to make the main page of the page move.</p> <p>I have absolutely no idea why the page is doing this, but then I have no idea why the page is doing a dozen other horrific markup abuses either. Could easily be rewritten to use just a few divs and <code>position: fixed</code> (with JS shim for IE6) instead of the crazy overflow stuff and the five levels of nested tables. (What is this, 1996?)</p>
