<p>You really don't want to do it this way. If you have access to the server take a look at <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Task_Scheduler" rel="nofollow noreferrer">scheduled tasks</a> (for windows) or <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cron" rel="nofollow noreferrer">cron jobs</a> (for linux).</p> <p>If you absolutely have no other alternatives the only way to accomplish this would be to create a loop with <code>setInterval</code> and check the current time in every iteration. But I just cringed writing that.</p>
<p>I am going to hazard an answer anyway:</p> <pre><code>setTimeout(function(){ //payload here }, 3600000*24); //one day. Launch at 5pm :) </code></pre> <p>This is quite simple and ugly, you probably want to add more detail to the condition (minutes, etc)</p>
<p>Another solution:</p> <pre><code>var now = new Date(); // 17 o'clock today var target = new Date(now.getYear(), now.getMonth(), now.getDay(), 17); setTimeout(function(){ // do stuff }, target.getTime() - now.getTime()); </code></pre> <p>But regarding your question this is not a convenient solution. It means that you have to have the JS code running the whole day (with my example you even have to reload the code every day). A cron job is really a much more appropriate solution.
