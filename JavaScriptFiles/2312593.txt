Setting browser homepage through JavaScript
<p>Is there any way to forcibly set a page as a homepage on the user's browser without any user notification or confirmation?</p>
<p>Even if it's possible, I doubt many SO users are going to rush to tell you how. This is extremely intrusive and abusive behavior.</p> <p>If I knew how, I wouldn't tell you. This is something that just should not be done.</p>
<p>No, there isn't, and thank God for that.</p> <p>Seriously, have you thought through the consequences? Every web site could set their users' home pages to their hearts' content. </p>
<p><strong>No.</strong> You cannot do this, and should not be able to do this as it is unethical to change a user's preferences without notifying him or her.</p> <p>Here is a good example of how to do it with notification, however: <a href="http://javascript.internet.com/page-details/set-homepage-link.html" rel="nofollow noreferrer">http://javascript.internet.com/page-details/set-homepage-link.html</a></p> <p>There's also the chance that you're interested in doing this for legitimate reasons, i.e. a corporate deployment script or some such. You can look into ways of doing it across an entire Active Directory using Group Policies and deployment scripts.</p>
