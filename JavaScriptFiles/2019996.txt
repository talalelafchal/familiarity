Debugging a javascript error that only occurs on the live site
<p>Something broke and I get "Object Expected" error on my live site, but I can't figure out where. If I run visual studio at the same time, it breakpoints it and shows the error as being half way along the viewstate, highlighted yellow... which is useless as its just gobbledegook.</p> <p>How can I debug this? I want to know what javascript its trying to run that is breaking it.</p>
