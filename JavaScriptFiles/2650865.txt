<p>You want to get the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Referer" rel="nofollow noreferrer"><strong>Referer</strong></a> information.</p> <p>In PHP, you can access it with <strong><code>$_SERVER['HTTP_REFERER']</code></strong>.</p> <p>In Javascript, I suppose that this should give you that information : <strong><code>document.referrer</code></strong>.</p> <p><br> Note : the referer is an information that's sent by the user's browser, which means :</p> <ul> <li>It can, or cannot, be sent <ul> <li>Which means your application can use it to provide some additionnal stuff,</li> <li>But must work even if the Referer is not there.</li> </ul></li> <li>It can be forged <ul> <li>Which means you must not trust it for any important feature.</li> <li>And you might want to filter/validate it</li> </ul></li> </ul>
