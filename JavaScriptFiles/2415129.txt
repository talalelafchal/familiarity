How can I know in Javascript if a web page is in English or Non-English?
<p>To be specific, how do you check the web page source to determine whether this web page is shown in English or other language, such as Japanese or French?</p>
<p>The following information will NOT always be present, and it will not actually tell you what language is used on the website.<br> charset, as in <code>&lt;meta http-equiv="Content-Type" content="text/html; charset=blah"&gt;</code><br> if charset is set to EUC-KR, you know its targeted towards people in korea, and korean characters can be used... [alt codes] </p> <p>Of course, even if EUC-KR is set as the charset, you can still use the english alphabet, and of course, write english sentences... </p> <p>Other than that, the only other way for you to detect the language of a website would be... actually looking at individual words and checking to see what dictionary they're in...</p>
<p>It's not possible, really.</p> <p>I mean, lets consider that a given page can be shown in both English <em>and</em> French at the same time. Perhaps you want to get something like the request-language in JavaScript. I <em>think</em> something like this may be available in the user-agent string, which <a href="http://www.quirksmode.org/js/detect.html" rel="nofollow noreferrer">you can get</a> (infact, perhaps the object has the request-language directly in it somewhere).</p> <p>Of course, even if you <em>do</em> get this, it doesn't mean the page is <em>in</em> that language.</p> <p>Given that you <em>are</em> the server, and you know what language you rendered in (hopefully) you can just pass this information to JavaScript via some variable.</p>
