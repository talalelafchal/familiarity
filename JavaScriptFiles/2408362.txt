Testing if javascript is enabled
<p>Is there a way to test to see if javascript is enabled to ensure an application that required javascript is not initiated when it is disabled or otherwise not available?</p>
<p>Not on initial load. You can try to use tricks like setting a cookie in JavaScript and check it on subsequent requests. The best way is to ensure that your site works without JavaScript, and use JavaScript to provide a better experience.</p>
<p>There is <a href="http://www.w3schools.com/TAGS/tag_noscript.asp" rel="nofollow noreferrer"><code>&lt;noscript&gt;</code></a>.</p>
<p>You could create a page with <code>&lt;noscript&gt;</code> content, and have that redirect using javascript to your actual application</p>
<p>By default, serve the no-Javascript version. Use Javascript to immediately redirect the user to the Javascript version (which will only work if Javascript is enabled).</p>
<p>The scenario is:</p> <ol> <li>Visitor makes first request to your site</li> <li>Deliver a page which sets two cookiesl one with javascript, another with your server side language.</li> <li>Header or Meta redirect to another page for testing.</li> <li>On test page, check if you received the server delivered cookie to see if cookie support is enabled, and test if javascript cookie was received for JS support enabled.</li> <li>Enjoy your new found knowledge.</li> </ol>
<p>I tend to use the following way.</p> <p>1) show an error message per default</p> <pre><code>&lt;div id="noJS"&gt;For use, you need JavaScript enabled. (nice images and perhaps a link to your fav. browser)&lt;/div&gt; </code></pre> <p>2) disable it via javascript and show the main app's container</p> <pre><code>$("#noJS").hide(); $("#app").show(); </code></pre> <p>If javascript is only needed for e.g. navigation, you should try to deliver a non-js version for non-js users in order to increase your audience.</p>
