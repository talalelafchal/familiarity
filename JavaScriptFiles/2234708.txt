<h3>With jQuery</h3> <p>You could use the masked-input plugin for jQuery: <a href="http://digitalbush.com/projects/masked-input-plugin/" rel="nofollow noreferrer">http://digitalbush.com/projects/masked-input-plugin/</a> There's a demo on that page demonstrating specifically the format you illustrated here.</p> <h3>With MooTools</h3> <p>There's also the iMask solution which is built off of Mootools: <a href="http://zendold.lojcomm.com.br/imask/" rel="nofollow noreferrer">http://zendold.lojcomm.com.br/imask/</a></p> <h3>Without a Framework</h3> <p>And dFilter for those not using any framework, preferring pure javascript: <a href="http://javascript.internet.com/forms/dfilter.html" rel="nofollow noreferrer">http://javascript.internet.com/forms/dfilter.html</a></p> <h3>Else...</h3> <p>If you're looking for a more thorough solution that doesn't require Mootools, jQuery, or some other framework, you might find Typecast to be of interest: <a href="http://typecast.arapehlivanian.com/index.html" rel="nofollow noreferrer">http://typecast.arapehlivanian.com/index.html</a></p>
