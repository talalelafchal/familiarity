JavaScript code compression
<p>Is there is way to compress JavaScript code?</p> <p>e.g.</p> <pre><code>function test(){ // some code here } </code></pre> <p>after compression it should be </p> <pre><code>function test(){//some code here} </code></pre> <p>Also, I need vise versa at the time of editing the code.</p>
<p>There are a number of tools available that can reduce the download size of your javascript, improving first-load performance. The general technique of making syntactic changes to your javascript, without changing its structure, is called minification; and the tools are minifiers. I know Google has an excellent tool, as does Yahoo - there are probably others as well.

<p>You can use a javascript minifier.</p> <p><a href="http://developer.yahoo.com/yui/compressor/" rel="nofollow noreferrer">YUI Compressor</a></p> <p><a href="http://fmarcia.info/jsmin/test.html" rel="nofollow noreferrer">JS Minifier</a></p> <p><a href="http://jscompress.com/" rel="nofollow noreferrer">jsCompress</a></p>

<p>There is already a compressed version of jQuery for you to use. For js you write yourself any of the other tools mentioned will work, I use YUI myself.</p>
<p>Good answers, for jquery you have a compressed version, remove the comments in the header to save some octets. For your own files, use the YUI compressor, i think it's the best.</p> <p>I would add if you want to save some time, you can also put all your Javascripts files in one, so you will save some precious time with http request (only for production though).</p>
<p>A good way to optimize your site is to include one javascript file for all. An article that explains the process of Javascript Bootstrapping can be found <a href="http://webreflection.blogspot.com/2007/01/simple-javascript-bootstrap-solution.html" rel="nofollow noreferrer">here</a>.</p> <p>Once you use the available compressors above, you should implement this so that your site run quicker.Hopefully this will help.</p>
<p>Use JSMIn its the best.</p>
