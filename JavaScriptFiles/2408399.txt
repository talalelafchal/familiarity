How to check special characters with Regular Expressions?
<p>In javascript I check for some characters but I want to allow underscores and slashes but I don't know how. </p> <pre><code> alias: /^[a-z-Z0-9]{2,35}$/ </code></pre> <p>How to put / and _ so it has not special meaning to Regexes. </p>
<p><code>_</code> has no special meaning at all in Regex.</p> <p>And if a character has special meaning, you can use <code>\</code> to "despecialize" it.</p> <pre><code>alias: /^[a-zA-Z0-9_\/]{2,35}/ </code></pre> <p>(BTW, you can use <code>\w</code> which means <code>[a-zA-Z0-9_]</code>, i.e. <code>/^[\w\/]{2,35}/</code>. The <code>\</code> in <code>\w</code> turns a normal character <code>w</code> to have a special meaning.)</p> <p>(Edit: Inside the <code>[â€¦]</code> the <code>/</code> will not be recognized as a delimiter so it is safe to use <code>/^[\w/]{2,35}/</code>. Thanks Andy E for showing this.)</p>
