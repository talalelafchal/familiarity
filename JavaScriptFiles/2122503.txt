How to think of Javascript-is this accurate?
<p>I'm working through some javascript examples, and I just did this one:</p> <pre><code>&lt;!DOCTYPE html PUBLIC "-//W3C//DTD XHTML 1.0 Strict//EN" "http://www.w3.org/TR/xhtml1/DTD/xhtml1-strict.dtd"&gt; &lt;html xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"&gt; &lt;head&gt; &lt;meta http-equiv="Content-Type" content="text/html; charset=UTF-8" /&gt; &lt;title&gt;Page title&lt;/title&gt; &lt;script type="text/javascript"&gt; function displayText() { document.getElementById('targetDIV').innerHTML = "You're using Javascript"; } &lt;/script&gt; &lt;/head&gt; &lt;body onload="displayText()"&gt; &lt;h2&gt;This should be before the other text.&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;div id="targetDIV"&gt; &lt;/div&gt; &lt;/body&gt; &lt;/html&gt; </code></pre> <p>OK. Very basic, I know-but I realized I was confused about the "why" of some things. Could it be accurate to say that:</p> <p>Function=<strong>WHAT</strong> will happen.</p> <p>The call (the body onload...)= <strong>WHEN</strong> it will happen.</p> <p>and div id="targetDIV" = <strong>WHERE</strong> it will happen</p> <p>I know this is the case in this example, but in general is that the way things work in Javascript?</p>
<p>Sound good to me.</p>
<p>Yes, that's a pretty good working model to carry in your head.</p> <p>onload for the body is called an Event and many objects issue events. Your function displayText is called in response to the onload Event and is therefore an event handler.</p> <p>The code inside your function can do anything, but in this case it dynamically loads some text into a tag on your page.</p> <p>There are a couple of other things worth pointing out at this point. You access the tag using document.getElementById. document is variable available to you in Javascript which contains a model of the page called the DOM or document object model. This is extremely powerful as it presents a hierarchical layout of everything on your page and allows you to manipulate the contents.</p> <p>getElementById() is a very useful function which searches the DOM tree and returns the object which has the ID that you specify, it's a sort of search. The text gets to your tag because you added the targetDIV id to the DIV tag and therefore you could find it via the DOM function.</p> <p>Welcome to programming in Javascript. Now you have a goood working model you'll find loads of really clever things you can do and your life as a web programmer will never be the same again.</p>
