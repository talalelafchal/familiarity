<p>The <code>id</code> attribute already uniquely defines an element (assuming your markup is valid). So, all you need to do is select the element with id <code>div_3</code> - and <em>then</em> worry about its <code>display</code> CSS property, if you need to:</p> <pre><code>var $myDiv = $('div_3'); if($myDiv.getStyle('display')) { // do something } </code></pre>
