Need something to give me a swap image on click behavior
<p>I can use CSS or javascript but I've been struggling with it. It needs to be an "on-click" behavior when you click on the number in the lower right corner... like this one: <a href="http://www.winteradagency.com/mrw/images/residential2.jpg" rel="nofollow noreferrer">http://www.winteradagency.com/mrw/images/residential2.jpg</a> So that when you click on #1 you get the first photo, #2 the 2nd one and so on... Any ideas? thanks!</p>
<p>Why not create four buttons and align it to right end, and everytime the image changes you update the text of the buttons. Each button could simply update the image to the one corresponding to its number.</p>
