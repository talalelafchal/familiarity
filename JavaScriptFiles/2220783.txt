Javascript passing custom objects to server side method
<p>I am using the ICallBack Interface and on the client side i need to send an object to the server method </p> <p>My object is a custom javascript object Example </p> <pre><code>var person=new Object(); person.Name='Francis'; person.ID='007'; </code></pre> <p>How do i pass this and decode it exaclty in the same format without using hidden fields ?</p> <p>Thanks Francis P.</p>
<p>You will need to serialize it as a string. Since the objects are simple and don't have any methods, you could use a <a href="http://www.json.org/js.html" rel="nofollow noreferrer">JSON stringify</a> function.</p> <p>As for passing it to the server, if you don't want to use a hidden field, then you could use a visible field, or bypass using a form altogether and send your request by stuffing it in the query string or using <a href="http://www.jibbering.com/2002/4/httprequest.html" rel="nofollow noreferrer">XMLHttpRequest</a>.</p>
<p>What exactly is the problem with using hidden fields?</p> <p>I would have serialised it into a JSON string, assigned that string to hidden form field, and that can be passed up to the server on a post where it can deserialised on the server.</p> <p>The <code>stringify</code> function in the JSON library at <a href="http://www.json.org/js.html" rel="nofollow noreferrer">http://www.json.org/js.html</a> is propbably the most suitable for achieving this.</p> <p>As for deserialising on the server, it depends on your server side language. Can you give us an indication as to this?</p>
