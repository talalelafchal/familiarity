Call a JavaScript function across browser tabs
<p>I have two browser tabs, tab1 and tab2.</p> <p>I have a function called execute in tab1, which I would like to call from the page in tab2.</p> <p>Is that possible and if so how?</p>
<p>You should show your html in the first place, but i assume your tab has a link, you could do like this:</p> <pre><code>&lt;a href="some-path" id="tab2"&gt;Tab 2&lt;/a&gt; </code></pre> <p><strong>JQuery:</strong></p> <pre><code>$('#tab2').click(function(){ // your function code here // prevent default action return false; }) </code></pre>
<p>I really cannot understand what you mean by the question.</p> <p>But you can pass javascript function references as arguments to other functions.(Be wary of object execution contexts).</p> <p>So while initializing "tab2", you could send in the function reference of <em>execute</em> of "tab1", to "tab2".</p> <p>Could have given a more definitive answer with an example , had you been clearer in your question.</p>
<p>JavaScript <strong><em>can not</em></strong> do cross-tab scripting in the browser (it is a security risk).</p> <p><strong><em>If however</em></strong> the 2nd tab was opened from a <code>window.open()</code> call, and the browsers settings were set up such that new popup windows open in a new tab instead -- <em>then <strong>yes</em></strong>, "tab1" can talk to "tab2"</p> <p>the first tab/window is called the <code>opener</code> and thus the new tab can call functions on the opener using this format:</p> <pre><code>opener.doSomething(); </code></pre> <p>likewise, the opener can call functions on the new tab/popup, by using the variable it created when creating the popup window.</p> <pre><code>var myPopup = window.open(url, name, features); myPopup.doStuffOnPopup(); </code></pre>
