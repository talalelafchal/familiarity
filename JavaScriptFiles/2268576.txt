How to update html outside of html frame using javascript?
<p>This is kind of complicated, so bear with me. I have a form that is inside a HTML frame. When I click the button on that form I would like to update the HTML that is outside of that frame. </p> <p>I'll try to illustrate this as best I can</p> <p><strong>Page Layout</strong></p> <ul> <li>Header Html Content (not in a frame)</li> <li>Side Menu Frame</li> <li>Content Menu Frame</li> </ul> <p>I have some HTML in the <strong>Header</strong> section of the page that I would like to update when a user clicks on a form button in the <strong>Content Menu Frame</strong>. </p> <p>The problem is I don't know how to access the HTML is the Header section from within the frame. So currently I have to hard refresh the page (ctrl + f5) for the changes to take place. </p> <p>Thanks!</p> <p>**Update </p> <p>Using old school style frames, not iframes</p>
<p>If you're talking about an iFrame, javascript in an iFrame can't access the HTML in the parent of that frame, you'll have to use a hard refresh.</p>
<p>you can access the head element of the top frame via </p> <pre><code>window.top.document.getElementsByTagName("head")[0]; </code></pre>
<p>I found one that worked.</p> <p>parent.top.location.reload(true)</p> <p>or something along those lines.</p>
