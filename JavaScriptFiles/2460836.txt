Find calling iframe id
<p>I have a number of iframes calling a function in my main page. Is there a way to find out the ID of the iframe which called the function?</p> <p>There are all part of same domain so that should not be an issue.</p> <p>Thank you for your time.</p>
<p>I'd say you need to send an identifier along with your method calls. It can be an optional parameter that does no harm if not present, like:</p> <pre><code>function foo(value, refId) { // do stuff with value if (typeof refId!=='undefined') { // handle this } } </code></pre>
<p>The most common way is to have the control pass itself to the function</p> <pre><code>&lt;script&gt;function doClick(e){ alert('id = ' + e.id); }&lt;/script&gt; &lt;span id=test onclick="doClick(this)"&gt; click here&lt;/span&gt; </code></pre> <p>Another way would be by using the:</p> <pre><code>event.srcElement </code></pre> <p>As documented <a href="http://www.dotnet247.com/247reference/a.aspx?u=http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/default.asp?url=/workshop/author/dhtml/reference/objects/obj_event.asp" rel="nofollow noreferrer">here</a>.</p> <p>A third way but not as reliable would be by using:</p> <pre><code>document.activeElement.name </code></pre> <p>The latter is not the best approach.</p> <p>In my personal opinion I'd go with the first one, as it will work 100% of the time, and won't give you browser issues.</p> <p><strong>UPDATE</strong> To get the current iframe's id (assuming you don't have nested iframes on the same page), you can simply use:</p> <pre><code>this.document.getElementsByTagName('body')[0]â€‹.id </code></pre> <p>And then simply pass it along with the call to your function. just make sure the body has the same ID as your iframe for example.</p> <p>Let me know if it helps you.</p>
