Window.onload and body.onload in IE
<p>When I'm trying to run the following code in IE:-</p> <pre><code>&lt;html&gt; &lt;head&gt; &lt;script language="javascript"&gt; window.onload=function(){ alert("Window.onload is working"); } &lt;/script&gt; &lt;/head&gt; &lt;body onload="alert('body.onload is working')"&gt; &lt;/body&gt; &lt;/html&gt; </code></pre> <p>It seems that the body.onload overrides window.onload. I want both of them because I have a page and When I press a button, I get a second file and put it inside a div in the first page. So, I need to use window.onload in the first page and when I get the second one, I use body.onload of the second one.</p> <p>I don't have this problem in FF,Opera,Chrome and Safari.</p> <p>I hope my problem is clear. Thanks for any help.</p>
<p>If you see the following page regarding <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/191157/window-onload-vs-body-onload" title="window.onload vs body.onload">http://stackoverflow.com/questions/191157/window-onload-vs-body-onload</a>, you'll find that they're the same thing. In other words, you're merely redefining what happens when the load event is fired.</p>
<p>If you "get [the] second file" using AJAX you should be able to use the response callback to perform any "onload" actions.<br> If you're using an <code>iframe</code> you should be able to bind to the <code>onload</code> event of the <code>iframe</code>'s <code>contentWindow</code>.</p>
<p>Why not put a javascript command at the end of the content that's being subsequently loaded into the div? Hence, when the content is loaded the last line is a javascript triggering the a call to your function. That's pretty much the simple way of making sure #1 content is loaded and #2 you create this function with full cross-browser efficiency.</p>
