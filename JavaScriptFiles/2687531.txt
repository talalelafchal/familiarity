How does javascript work in the browser address bar? 
<p>How does Javascript work in the browser address bar? </p> <p>To be more specific: how can I make a script that goes to a web site and clicks a button on that site? Not maliciously, of course, I'd like to be able to do this for personal use.</p>
<p>JavaScript in the address bar is evaluated just like any JavaScript.</p> <p>On your second point, you don't. That's called cross site scripting or XSS. You can't have JavaScript from one site modify another site.</p> <p>You could potentially write an extension to your web browser that will accomplish what you want.</p>
<p>You want to make a <a href="http://strangej.detrave.net/jb/tut.php" rel="nofollow noreferrer">bookmarklet</a>.</p>
<p>View the source code of the page and find the reference to the button you'd like to click. You're looking for something like this:</p> <pre><code>&lt;input type="submit" value="Click Here" id="theButtonId"/&gt; </code></pre> <p>Then you can type in the address bar:</p> <pre><code>javascript:document.getElementById("theButtonId").click(); </code></pre> <p>To navigate to a website, do this:</p> <pre><code>javascript:window.location='http://www.google.com'; </code></pre>
<p>What you are talking about is called a "bookmarklet", and depending on exactly what you are talking about, you could probably accomplish it via a bookmarklet... but it may be more trouble than it's worth.</p> <p>Bookmarklets are generally used to make simple modifications on the page you are currently viewing. For example, a book-marklet may hide all the pictures on a page.</p> <p>You can write bookmarklets that interact with another page, for a complex example see the jQUeryUI boomarklet: <a href="http://jqueryui.com/themeroller/developertool/" rel="nofollow noreferrer">here</a> </p> <p>However, generally the type of thing you are talking about would be accomplished via something like a Grease Monkey/User Script and/or "extension". I would recommend going that route instead.</p>
