Can anyone explain namespace in javascript with an example?
<p>I am bit confused with namespaces of function in javascript. Can I have function with same names? </p> <p>Thanks</p>
<p>There is no official concept of a namespace in Javascript like there is in C++. However, you can wrap functions in Javascript objects to emulate namespaces. For example, if you wanted to write a function in a "namespace" called <code>MyNamespace</code>, you might do the following:</p> <pre><code>var MyNamespace = {}; MyNamespace.myFunction = function(arg1, arg2) { // do things here }; MyNamespace.myOtherFunction = function() { // do other things here }; </code></pre> <p>Then, to call those functions, you would write <code>MyNamespace.myFunction(somearg, someotherarg);</code> and <code>MyNamespace.myOtherFunction();</code>.</p> <p>I should also mention that there are many different ways to do namespacing and class-like things in Javascript. My method is just one of those many.</p> <p>For more discussion, you might also want to take a look at <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/13021/is-there-a-concise-way-to-do-namespacing-in-javascript">this</a> question.</p>
<p>Currently, no JavaScript implementations support namespaces, if you're referring to ECMAScript 6/JavaScript 2 namespaces.</p> <p>If you're referring to how namespacing is done today, it's just the use of one object and putting every method you want to define onto it.</p> <pre><code>var myNamespace = {}; myNamespace.foo = function () { /*...*/ }; myNamespace.bar = function () { /*...*/ }; </code></pre>
