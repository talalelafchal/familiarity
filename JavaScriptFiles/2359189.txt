onclick event in the javascript
<p>I am very new to javascript I know that you can add an onclick="" event to a html element... but is it possible in the javascript itself to declare that when someone clicks on x element an event is triggered?</p>
<pre><code>&lt;input id="myElement" type="button" value="Click me!" /&gt; &lt;script type="text/javascript"&gt; document.getElementById('myElement').onclick = function () { alert('Hello, world!'); } &lt;/script&gt; </code></pre> <p>Make sure that you either run this after the element already exists (scripts at the bottom), or when the DOM is ready. (You <em>could</em> use <code>window.onload</code> for that, but you might just want to use jQuery from the beginning so that, among other things, you get a magical DOM-ready function. <code>onload</code> has some downsides, like waiting for images to load.)</p>
<p>You would be best to leverage jQuery for this. It's easy to learn and easy to use.</p> <p><a href="http://api.jquery.com/click/" rel="nofollow noreferrer">http://api.jquery.com/click/</a></p>
