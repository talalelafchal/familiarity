Min/Max across an array of objects
<p>It has been done to death pretty much, here on SO and around the 'Net. However I was wondering if there was a way to leverage the standard min/max functions of:</p> <pre><code>Array.max = function(array) { return Math.max.apply(Math, array); }; Array.min = function(array) { return Math.min.apply(Math, array); }; </code></pre> <p>So I can search across an array of objects of say:</p> <pre><code>function Vector(x, y, z) { this.x = x; this.y = y; this.z = z; } var ArrayVector = [ /* lots of data */ ]; var min_x = ArrayVector.x.min(); // or var max_y = ArrayVector["y"].max(); </code></pre> <p>Currently I have to loop through the array and compare the object values manually and craft each one to the particular need of the loop. A more general purpose way would be nice (if slightly slower).</p>
<p>You could make some changes to your <code>Array.min</code>and <code>max</code> methods to accept a property name, extract that property of each object in the array, with the help of <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/En/Core_JavaScript_1.5_Reference/Objects/Array/Map" rel="nofollow noreferrer"><code>Array.prototype.map</code></a>, and the max or min value of those extracted values:</p> <pre><code>Array.maxProp = function (array, prop) { var values = array.map(function (el) { return el[prop]; }); return Math.max.apply(Math, values); }; var max_x = Array.maxProp(ArrayVector, 'x'); </code></pre> <p>I just want to mention that the <code>Array.prototype.map</code> method will be available on almost all modern browsers, and it is part of the <a href="http://www.ecmascript.org/docs.php" rel="nofollow noreferrer">ECMAScript 5th Edition Specification</a>, but Internet Explorer doesn't have it, however you can easily include an implementation like the found on the <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/En/Core_JavaScript_1.5_Reference/Objects/Array/Map" rel="nofollow noreferrer">Mozilla Developer Center</a>.</p>
