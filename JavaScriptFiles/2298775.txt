explore properties and/or functions of javascript objects
<p>Is there any way i can explore the properties and /or functions of a java script object(Like a telerik menu or anyother 3rd party object)? the way i can by debugging and breaking and then adding an object in the watch or by using intellisense in VS.</p> <p>I use vs2008 and i do have the basic intellisense for javascript.</p> <p>I think i will be able to get a lot more done if i could do it.</p>
<p>A personal favorite of mine is to do it directly in browser, using Firefox and the Firebug extension/plugin.</p> <p>You can set breakpoints, and explore the javascript object itself, as well as DOM elements, from the plugin window. You also get a handy console/interpreter for exploring or executing arbitrary JS (such as to manually trigger a method, or an AJAX call).</p>
<p>I'm not sure if this is what you have in mind, but you can iterate through the members of an object like so:</p> <pre><code>var myObj = {a: 42, b:"blah", c: function(){alert("hello world");}}; for(var member in myObj){ console.log("Name: " + member); console.log("Value: " + myObj[member]); } </code></pre>
