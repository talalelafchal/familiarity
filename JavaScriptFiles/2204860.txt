getting diagonal and vertical adjacent cells of a table in jquery
<p>I have a 4X4 table. I want to get to get adjacent that are vertical, and diagonal on the top on bottom. I don't have a problem getting them when the cell i click on is around the edges because i can use something like this.</p> <pre><code>above = $(that).parent().prev().children().first() below = $(that).parent().prev().children().last() diagonalLeft = $(that).parent().children().last().prev() diagonalRight = $(that).parent().children().first().next() </code></pre> <p>But when i have one of these cases, when I can't use the first or last one, I don't know what to do. I can't figure out the logic for it.</p>
<p>You just have to count backwards to tell what column you're currently in.</p> <pre><code>var $that = $('td.yourActiveTD') , rowNum = $that.parent().prevAll('tr').length , colNum = $that.prevAll('td').length , above = $that // td .parent() // tr .parent() // table or tbody .children('tr') .eq(rowNum - 1) // the row above this one .children('td') .eq(colNum) // in the same column as this ; </code></pre> <p>From that, you should be able to get whichever cell you want just by changing the <code>.eq()</code> lines.</p>
