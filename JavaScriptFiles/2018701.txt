Javascript execution sequence
<p>The SO question (<a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/1795438/load-and-execution-sequence-of-a-web-page">load-and-execution-sequence-of-a-web-page</a>)gives details into the order of execution of html page. It states - that the script tag is executed sequentially with single thread. </p> <p>I have the following code on my page:</p> <pre><code>if(booleanTest)eval('parent.'+callback+'();'); parent.hideWin(); return false; </code></pre> <p>Assuming that the callback method is having a simple while loop that ran for a large number of times (eg : 30K times), I noticed that the hideWin was getting executed even before the callback even completed.(Tested on IE7)</p> <p>The point is - if the execution is sequential then why is the above behavior in place - is it something specific to browser?.</p>
<p>yeah, the second line will execute only after the if+eval. i would do an alert before hidewin to check if booleanTest and any other state is the expected vals</p>
