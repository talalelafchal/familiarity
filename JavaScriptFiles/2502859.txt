onchange event from select box to update field
<p>On this page: <a href="http://www.blackdownluxurylettings.co.uk/place_booking/2010-3-18,2" rel="nofollow noreferrer">http://www.blackdownluxurylettings.co.uk/place_booking/2010-3-18,2</a> </p> <p>I am using an onchange event on the "number of days" select box to update the "departure date" field.</p> <p>But currently nothing is happening. </p> <p>Any ideas?</p>
<p>If I recall correctly, the regular Javascript <code>onChange</code> event only fires once the select box loses focus AND it's contents have been changed. I don't know how jQuery achieves it, but their <a href="http://api.jquery.com/change/" rel="nofollow noreferrer">change</a> method will fire whenever the contents are updated.</p> <p>Also, I get the following error in my Javascript console when loading your page:</p> <pre><code>[cycle] terminating; zero elements found by selector </code></pre>
<p>Just looking at it quickly: wouldn't you want the <code>ONCHANGE</code> event attached to the <code>SELECT</code> tag rather than the individual options?</p>
<p>You can bind it this way using JQuery:</p> <pre><code>$("#ddlNumberOfDays").bind('change', mainPharmacy_Change) </code></pre> <p>Maybe for javascript, you should just try <code>'change'</code>.</p>
