Javascript global variable question
<p>I wanted to show problem with <a href="http://screencast.com/t/M2E5MzE1" rel="nofollow noreferrer">this video. Please watch...</a></p> <p>I've 2 pages. Second page is sending selected pictures to the opener window(first one) using fResimleriEkle function.</p> <p>I'm setting every element of array to another array variables (ArrResimler and ArrMetinler).</p> <p>But when i fire the fAlbumOlustur function by clicking to button, i can't see the values of global variables. </p> <p>Is there any problem about global variables? </p> <p>The problem is in the picture: <img src="http://content.screencast.com/users/uzay95/folders/Jing/media/a1dcc552-8013-4c08-ab23-b95eba2df7f5/2010-03-10_2258.png" alt="alt text"></p> <p>Thank you for your help....</p>
<p>Maybe I'm missing something, but can't you just set a "watch" to the global variables you're interested in?</p>
<p><a href="http://c2.com/cgi/wiki?GlobalVariablesAreBad" rel="nofollow noreferrer">Global variables are bad</a>! Another one about how <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/484635/are-global-variables-bad">they are bad</a>...</p> <p>You could always pass the array in a "buffer" parameter in your functions which is cleaner IMO.</p> <p><strong>Example:</strong></p> <pre><code>&lt;script type="text/javascript"&gt; function WorkWithArray(myArray, someOtherParam) { if (myArray.constructor.toString().indexOf("Array") == -1) return false; //Work with myArray here myArray[myArray.length] = 'blah'; return true; } &lt;/script&gt; </code></pre> <p>In JavaScript, we have functions and we have arguments that we pass into those functions. But how JavaScript handles what youâ€™re passing in is not always clear. When you start getting into object-oriented development, you may find yourself perplexed over why you have access to values sometimes but not other times.</p> <p>When passing in a primitive type variable like a string or a number, the value is passed in by value. This means that any changes to that variable while in the function are completely separate from anything that happens outside the function.</p> <p>Passing in an object (an array is an object), however, passes it in by reference. In this case, any property of that object is accessible within the function.</p> <p>See <a href="http://snook.ca/archives/javascript/javascript_pass" rel="nofollow noreferrer">JavaScript: Passing by Value or by Reference</a> for more info.</p>
<p>Wrong line is:</p> <pre><code> arrResims = ArrResimler = sResimler </code></pre> <p>I can't set the values again after above line.</p>
