<p>You have an error on this line:</p> <pre><code>obj.style.left = theLeft + 'px' ; </code></pre> <p>Because you are doing this</p> <pre><code>setTimeout("placeIt('layer1')", 500); </code></pre> <p>Which leads to this</p> <pre><code>obj = document.getElementById(obj); </code></pre> <p>So whatever layer1 is, make sure there is actually an element in the DOM with that ID before you call the function.</p>
