How does my Site look in other countries
<p>I just made some changes to my website, it will display different greeting text for different continents, I have used Google's API to get location of the user</p> <pre><code>region = google.loader.ClientLocation.address.region; country = google.loader.ClientLocation.address.country; countrycode = google.loader.ClientLocation.address.country_code; </code></pre> <p>But now i want to test this, so is there any way that i can access my site with the IP of another continent or country, or any other solution for this.</p>
<p>You could use an online proxy service, located in the country you want to test for. A list of free online proxies can be found at <a href="http://proxy.org/" rel="nofollow noreferrer">http://proxy.org/</a>.</p>
<p>I've built a tool that you might find useful, called <a href="http://www.geopeeker.com/">GeoPeeker</a>. In my own testing I found proxies to be unreliable, so I designed GeoPeeker to use actual servers that render a site and provide DNS information from various remote locations. It's handy for troubleshooting CDN and DNS issues.</p> <p>It's also free to use and there are no ads.</p>
