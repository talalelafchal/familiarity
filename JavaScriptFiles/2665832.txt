deleting files in javascript
<p>is it possible to delete a file(s) inside the directory by just using javascript ?. what I currently have is, an index.php which displays the name of the files in the same directory and and a checkbox to each file name and at the bottom is a delete button. what I want to happen is, delete all the selected checkboxes once the delete button is clicked. I am not using mysql here, just a plain php file that displays the names. can someone show me how to delete the selected files using javascript ?</p>
<p>You can use AJAX,and delete files using PHP on server. You can't manipulate with files in pure javascript.</p>
<p>You can not delete files with javascript for <strong>security reasons</strong>. Bad guys can delete files of your stytem :( However, you can do so with the combination of server-side language such as PHP, ASP.NET, etc using what is know as <strong><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ajax_%28programming%29" rel="nofollow noreferrer">Ajax</a></strong>.</p> <p><strong>Note:</strong> Javascript is moving to adding/becoming the server-side language options. <strong><a href="http://nodejs.org/" rel="nofollow noreferrer">Node JS</a></strong> is an example of that.</p> <p><strong>Update Based On Comment:</strong></p> <p>You can delete files something like this:</p> <pre><code>&lt;a href="#" class="delete"&gt;Delete&lt;/a&gt; </code></pre> <p><strong>JQuery:</strong></p> <pre><code>$(function(){ $('a.delete').click(function(){ $.ajax({ url:'delete.php', data:'id/name here', method:'GET', success:function(response){ if (response === 'deleted') { alert('Deleted !!'); } } }); }); }); </code></pre> <p><strong>PHP:</strong></p> <pre><code> if (isset($_GET['id/name here'])) { if (unlink('your_folder_path' . $_GET['id/name here'])) { echo 'Deleted'; } } </code></pre>
<p>You don't need JavaScript for that but a HTML <code>form</code> which sends the filenames to a PHP script on the server which deletes the files. See <a href="http://www.w3schools.com/php/php_forms.asp" rel="nofollow noreferrer">this example</a>.</p>
<p>In this, use ajax function or otherwise by javascript in onclick function provide the submit action and refresh the whole page.</p>
<p>You need to implement the file deletion function in PHP based on the built-in unlink() function. Be careful here!! for example, you should read the list of file names and calculate an ID for each of them, and your delete function would accept IDs and NOT the real filename(s). </p> <p>Then, when you send the file list to the browser, it includes the generated IDs as hidden fields or object attributes, etc. From JavaScript, you can use an HTTP request to send a list of file IDs to be deleted, based on the checkboxes. Your PHP script would call your delete function for the IDs.</p>
