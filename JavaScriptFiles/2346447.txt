how to remove toolbar during onload function?
<p>I have got one critical problem in Javascript; please help me to fix it.</p> <p>I have written the onload function in one JSP page, say login.jsp.</p> <p>In that function I used the window.open method to open a new window again with the same JSP page login.jsp with the toolbars disabled.</p> <p>Now what is happening is that when I am opening the same page again in a new window, obviously that body onload function will get called again and it opens a new window in an indefinite loop.</p> <p>But what I want is, I have to remove that onload function in that JSP page once a new window is opened.</p> <p>Is it possible to remove that onload function while it is getting opened in the new window?</p> <p>Could anyone please come up with an idea or little bit of code to do this using java script??</p>
<p>In your <code>onload</code>, check if the <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en/DOM/window.opener" rel="nofollow noreferrer"><code>window.opener</code> property</a> is null.</p> <p>If yes, open the new window.</p>
