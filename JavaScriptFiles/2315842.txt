Is it possible to build application using Javascript on Linux platforms?
<p>Javascript is widely used to create apps in the web. How about desktop, etc? Gnome Shell is made of it. I'm just curious if there's a way or something which allows devs to access Gnome/Clutter graphics libraries? </p>
<p>I dont know much about the Gnome/Clutter graphics access, But several SSJS (<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Server-side_JavaScript" rel="nofollow noreferrer">Server-side_JavaScript</a>) available that can work on Linux environments.</p>
<p>The three best options that I know of are <a href="http://www.mozilla.org/rhino/" rel="nofollow noreferrer">Rhino</a> (using Swing, or other Java graphics frameworks), <a href="http://live.gnome.org/Seed" rel="nofollow noreferrer">Seed</a>, and <a href="http://live.gnome.org/Gjs/" rel="nofollow noreferrer">Gjs</a>.</p> <p>Seed and Gjs are both Gnome projects that bind the GTK+ and Gnome libraries to JavaScript. Seed uses the JavaScriptCore runtime from WebKit and Gjs uses Mozilla's Spidermonkey engine. Gnome Shell is using Gjs.</p> <p>Another option that, as far as I know, is still pretty immature is <a href="http://code.google.com/p/ilovegom/" rel="nofollow noreferrer">Gom</a>. Instead of just a JavaScript binding for GTK+, it has an HTML-like DOM interface.</p>
<p>Yes using Rhino although it looks like a convolated path...</p>
<p>There are various ways to do this. Besides Rhino, V8/node.js is one of them. </p>
