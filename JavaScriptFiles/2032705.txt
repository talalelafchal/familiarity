Regexp plurals - how?
<p>I want to detect two versions of the same thing, plural and now</p> <p>eg:</p> <p>"piece" and "pieces" should both return a match.</p> <pre><code>var re_1 = new RegExp("how many piece", "i"); </code></pre> <p>or </p> <pre><code>var re_1 = new RegExp("how many pieces", "i"); </code></pre> <p>How do I form a RegExp expression in Javascript to detect both singular and plural in the same pattern?</p>
<pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; /how many pieces?/.test('how many piece') true &gt;&gt;&gt; /how many pieces?/.test('how many pieces') true &gt;&gt;&gt; /how many pieces?/.test('how many piecez') true &gt;&gt;&gt; /how many pieces?/.test('how many piec') false </code></pre> <p>The question mark denotes that the prior character is optional. You shouldn't need to construct a <code>new RegExp</code> unless you're dynamically generating it, feel free to add any additional options after the end <code>/</code> ( g for global, i for case insensitive ).</p>
