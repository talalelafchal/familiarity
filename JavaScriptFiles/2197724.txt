how can i get data from a remote website in JavaScript?
<p>I want to get the data from <code>http://whatismyip.com/automation/n09230945.asp</code> using JavaScript. How can I do this?</p> <p>I can get the data from ASP.NET by using WebClient class but how can we get data using JavaScript?</p>
<p>You will need to use <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ajax_(programming)" rel="nofollow noreferrer">AJAX</a>. However, unless the service provides a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JSONP#JSONP" rel="nofollow noreferrer">JSONP</a> interface, AJAX is limited to getting pages from the same domain as the page it runs on. See: <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Same_origin_policy" rel="nofollow noreferrer">Same origin policy</a>.</p>
<p>The way to get around the same origin policy is to write a script in ASP on your own server that gets the data, and then get that script through AJAX in your page.</p>
<p>Use YQL - <a href="http://developer.yahoo.com/yql/guide/yql-code-examples.html#yql_html_scraper" rel="nofollow">http://developer.yahoo.com/yql/guide/yql-code-examples.html#yql_html_scraper</a></p> <p>It essentially acts as a proxy to grab page data for you through their service. You can interact with it solely with JavaScript.</p>
