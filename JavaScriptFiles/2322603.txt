Move mouse pointer in JavaScript
<p>Is it possible to move the mouse so that it is positioned inside a text input using JavaScript?</p>
<p>It would be a huge [security?] issue if they allowed for something like this. Imagine: you have a setInterval(function(){moveMouseToTopLeftCorner and alert garbage}, 1)...<br> The user would have his mouse moved to the top left. And then alert would show up [which could be closed with enter].. upon which an alert would immediately pop up again. </p> <p>You'd actually have to use your keyboard to open taskmanager and kill the browser >_> </p> <p>However, it is probably possible with ActiveX [although thats IE only... and dumb]</p>
<p>I don't know about moving the actual rendered mouse, but could you just set the focus to the element?</p> <pre><code>document.getElementById('the_text_input_id').focus() </code></pre>
<p>Please see this question: </p> <blockquote> <p><a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/2105733/mouse-move-on-element/2105766">Mouse move on element</a></p> </blockquote> <p>Besides that, I think you are committing major design mistake by taking control of any of the users input in anyway (maybe besides setting the focus of a form element)</p>
<p>Here is a function that select text in an input or textarea:</p> <pre><code> function textSelect(inp, s, e) { e = e || s; if (inp.createTextRange) { var r = inp.createTextRange(); r.collapse(true); r.moveEnd('character', e); r.moveStart('character', s); r.select(); }else if(inp.setSelectionRange) { inp.focus(); inp.setSelectionRange(s, e); } } </code></pre> <p>To place the cursor at the 12th position:</p> <pre><code>textSelect(document.getElementById('theInput'), 12); </code></pre> <p>To select a portion of the input field:</p> <pre><code>textSelect(document.getElementById('theInput'), 12, 15); </code></pre>
