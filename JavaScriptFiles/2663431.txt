File input javascript event, is there an event fire when someone click okay on the dialog box?
<p>When someone click on Browse for the input file below:</p> <pre><code>&lt;input type="file" name="blah" /&gt; </code></pre> <p>A dialog box will appear. The user will then select a file and click 'Ok'. The dialog box will close. Is there an event fire because of that? I tried onfocus and onblur, it didnt work out. </p> <p>The only way I can think of is to start a timer to check the value content when it is onfocus. Not that elegant. Any solution?</p> <p>Cheers, Mickey</p>
<p>I think you can try to listen for an <strong>"onchange"</strong> event on your element.</p> <p>The only drawback with this is if the user selects the same file using "browse" twice, it wont fire as the contents didnt change but I dont know if that is a requirement in your case.</p>
