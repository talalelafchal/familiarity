Create a Count Up Timer in Javascript/Jquery
<p>Hey, I'm just wondering if someone could tell me, or point me in the right direction, on how to make a count up timer.</p> <p>I'd like to have it constantly, from the second I put it into place count up saying the seconds, minutes, hours, days, and years.</p> <p>Thanks!</p>
<pre><code>&lt;script language="JavaScript"&gt; TargetDate = "12/31/2020 5:00 AM"; BackColor = "palegreen"; ForeColor = "navy"; CountActive = true; CountStepper = 1; LeadingZero = true; DisplayFormat = "%%D%% Days, %%H%% Hours, %%M%% Minutes, %%S%% Seconds."; FinishMessage = "It is finally here!"; &lt;/script&gt; &lt;script language="JavaScript" src="http://scripts.hashemian.com/js/countdown.js"&gt;&lt;/script&gt; </code></pre>

The example used counts up, but I also used it to count down.</p>
<p><a href="http://praveenlobo.com/blog/javascript-countup-timer/" rel="nofollow noreferrer">Here is a Javascript CountUp Timer I wrote.</a> It takes a timestamp to start counting the time from, an ID to put the timer, and a message to append to the timer. Please find the demo page link at the bottom of the post there(unable to provide the link here). Demo page has two types of counters.</p>
