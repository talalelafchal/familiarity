<p>The jQuery library, and virtually all of its plugins are constrained within the jQuery namespace. As a general rule, "global" objects are stored inside the jQuery namespace as well, so you shouldn't get a clash between jQuery and any other library (like Prototype, MooTools, or YUI).</p> <p>That said, there is one caveat: By default, jQuery uses "$" as a shortcut for "jQuery"</p> <p>However, you can override that default by calling jQuery.noConflict() at any point after jQuery and the other library have both loaded. For example:</p> <pre><code> &lt;script&gt; jQuery.noConflict(); // Use jQuery via jQuery(...) jQuery(document).ready(function(){ jQuery("div").hide(); }); // Use Prototype with $(...), etc. $('someid').hide(); &lt;/script&gt; </code></pre> <p>this way Query won't conflict with another library</p>
<p>Yes you can. However, you may want to make use of <a href="http://api.jquery.com/jQuery.noConflict/" rel="nofollow noreferrer">jQuery's <code>noConflict()</code></a> statement. </p> <p>I recommend putting your jQuery script directive in the ScriptManager, and use AJAXToolkit's <code>ToolkitScriptManager</code>, in place of <code>ScriptManager</code>.</p> <p>Wrapping your <code>&lt;Scripts&gt;</code> in a <code>&lt;CompositeScript&gt;</code> tag, in conjunction with AJAXToolkit's <code>ToolkitScriptManager</code>, will combine all script files into 1 download at runtime.</p>
