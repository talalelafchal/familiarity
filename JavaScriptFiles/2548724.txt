How to check if an HTML element is supported by a browser
<p>Is there a way to check if a tag is valid html tag and / or supported by the browser ? Like if I type text "hi" in a set of p1 tag, browsers wont show anything in display, but p1 is not a valid html tag. How to check this using javascript ?</p>
<p>If you want to test whether HTML5 tags and attributes are supported, you can use <a href="http://www.modernizr.com/" rel="nofollow noreferrer">Modernizr</a>—it's a JavaScript file you include which does the work for you. It also adds support for things like <code>&lt;section&gt;</code> and <code>&lt;header&gt;</code> to the browser using JavaScript so you can go ahead and use them without fear.</p> <p>If you want to be sure that an XHTML 1.0 or HTML4 tag is supported… well, you can assume it is. No one uses Netscape 4 any more.</p>
