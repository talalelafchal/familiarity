JavaScript to retrieve value from grid
<pre><code>protected void GridLedger_RowDataBound(object sender, GridViewRowEventArgs e) { if (e.Row.RowType == DataControlRowType.DataRow) { e.Row.Attributes.Add("onMouseDown", "var str = document.getElementById('" + e.Row.ClientID + "').cells[0].innerText; document.getElementById('&lt;%=TextBox1.ClientID%&gt;').value = str;"); } } </code></pre> <p>I have called a <code>rowdatabound</code> event in which I am using a script like this. I get the error:</p> <blockquote> <p>object element not found or not an object</p> </blockquote> <p>Please help me.</p>
<p>I would recommend you to use the jQuery library or any other javascript framework to make your life a LOT easier.</p> <p>This errors seems to me that you either can't find the object you are looking for or the property cells does not exist. This might even differ from browser to browser ...</p> <p>Have a look at your generated code and see what the ID of that error is ... </p>
