Store data as Text File from HTML
<p>I want store data from an html page to a text file using javascript on Client Side. Any method is there?</p>
<p>You cannot store as file in Client Side with javascript, most of the browsers not allowed you to do that.</p>
<p>You can't work with the filesystem with JavaScript. Flash can work with the filesystem, so a combination of JavaScript and Flash (such as <a href="http://downloadify.info/" rel="nofollow noreferrer">Downloadify</a>) will work.</p>
