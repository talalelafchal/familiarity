How to disable IE message for reference information with JavaScript?
<p>How to disable IE (browsers) message for reference information with JavaScript?</p> <p>this is the situation:</p> <p>I have a form that i submit, after submitting i reload the page and appears the following message : </p> <p>"To display this page Firefox has to resend information that will repeat previous actions (such as a demand or confirmation of an order)."</p> <p>i need help...</p> <p>Thanks </p> <p>ps: sorry I'm not English :)</p>
<p>This message appears whenever you reload a page that was received from an HTTP POST.<br> It appears because HTTP POSTs are intended to be non-repeatable.<br> For example, if you buy something online, the website will usually send an HTTP POST to its server saying that you spent <em>X</em> dollars. Without that warning, it would be possible for Firefox or IE to automatically reload the page, sending a second HTTP POST. This would tell the server that you spent <em>X</em> dollars a second time, and would make you very angry. Therefore, the browsers have that warning.</p> <p>To get rid of it, change your page to an HTTP GET.</p> <p>For example:</p> <pre><code>&lt;form method="GET"&gt; </code></pre> <p>Alternatively, you can keep it an HTTP POST, and have the server send a redirect in response to the POST, telling the browser to send an HTTP GET to a separate page. This means that you don't have the risk of sending the request twice, as I described above.</p>
<p>Take a look at the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Post/Redirect/Get" rel="nofollow noreferrer">POST/Redirect/GET</a> pattern.</p>
