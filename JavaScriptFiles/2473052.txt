Is there a way to capture images from Webcam?
<p>Is there a way to capture images from a webcam with JavaScript?</p>
<p>Nope - think of the security implications! </p> <p>It is possible with Flash, but the user will see a popup requesting access to their webcam. </p>
<p>If the webcam had a web interface, then in theory it would be possible to just slap an image tag into a page somewhere and point it directly at the cam's snapshot interface:</p> <pre><code>&lt;img src="http://address.of.webcam.example.com/webcam/capture" /&gt; </code></pre> <p>But otherwise, no. Standard Javascript has no API for accessing a webcam. There's no</p> <pre><code>var wc = new WebCam(); img = wc.capture(); </code></pre> <p>type calls you can do.</p>
<p>The situation has changed from when this question was originally posted. The <a href="http://w3c.github.io/mediacapture-main/getusermedia.html" rel="nofollow">getUserMedia</a> API was introduced to allow things like capturing webcam images. You can find <a href="http://www.html5rocks.com/en/tutorials/getusermedia/intro/" rel="nofollow">tutorials</a> and <a href="https://github.com/jhuckaby/webcamjs" rel="nofollow">plugins</a> demonstrating it.</p> <p>But MDN now says the Navigator.getUserMedia API is deprecated in favour of the experimental API <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/MediaDevices/getUserMedia" rel="nofollow">MediaDevices.getUserMedia</a>. The getUserMedia tutorials and plugins don't work on iOS devices - they just don't support it.</p> <p>The answer at the moment seems to be that there is an HTML API for it, but browser support is patchy and the API is possibly on its way out. <a href="http://caniuse.com/#feat=stream" rel="nofollow">You can only use it</a> in Firefox and IE Edge, and in Chrome only from an https domain.</p> <p>I would like to revive this question and ask if anyone knows of any web API that will successfully capture webcam images in all major browsers and devices.</p>
