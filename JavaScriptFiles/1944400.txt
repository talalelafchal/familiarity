Is there a way to detect a viewer's homepage in javascript?
<p>Ideally I would like a cross browser solution.</p> <p>Thanks!</p>
<p>Nope, there's definitely no way. The user's home page is clearly part his own, private data, and having programmatic access to it would be a security nightmare.</p>
<p>No, javascript which runs in a sandbox, don't have access to these kind of resources.</p> <p>Read this article on</p> <p><strong><a href="http://www.devarticles.com/c/a/JavaScript/JavaScript-Security/" rel="nofollow noreferrer">JavaScript Security</a></strong></p> <blockquote> <p><strong>JavaScript Security Models</strong> </p> <p>The modern JavaScript security model is based upon Java. In theory, downloaded scripts are run by default in a restricted “sandbox” environment that isolates them from the rest of the operating system. Scripts are permitted access only to data in the current document or closely related documents (generally those from the same site as the current document). No access is granted to the local file system, the memory space of other running programs, or the operating system’s networking layer. Containment of this kind is designed to prevent malfunctioning or malicious scripts from wreaking havoc in the user’s environment. The reality of the situation, however, is that often scripts are not contained as neatly as one would hope. There are numerous ways that a script can exercise power beyond what you might expect, both by design and by accident.</p> <p>The fundamental premise of browsers’ security models is that there is no reason to trust randomly encountered code such as that found on Web pages, so JavaScript should be executed as if it were hostile. Exceptions are made for certain kinds of code, such as that which comes from a trusted source. Such code is allowed extended capabilities, sometimes with the consent of the user but often without requiring explicit consent. In addition, scripts can gain access to otherwise privileged information in other browser windows when the pages come from related domains.</p> </blockquote>
