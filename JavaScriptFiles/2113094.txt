Can javascript be used to write to a file?
<p>Can javascript be used to write to a file ? Sorry restate that (Can javascript be used to write to a file on the web server it is hosted on? ).</p>
<p>Unless used in server-side contexts: <strong>no</strong>, sorry.</p>
<p>Not cross-compatibly, unless you do certain trickery. A trusted applet, for example, has complete access to the user's file system, and it can expose javascript methods. Expose a write method in a trusted applet, and you're good to go.</p>
<p>They used to call cookies "really small files on your computer", so I say: "Yes, yes it can."</p> <p><strong>update based on edit</strong></p> <p>Yes, you have to use AJAX to call a web service on the web server.</p>
<p>It can if the "file" is a cookie. I will leave research on that up to the reader.</p>
<p>No. if you need to store data on the client, you can use cookies, Google Gears, or the <a href="http://www.google.com/search?ie=UTF-8&amp;oe=UTF-8&amp;sourceid=navclient&amp;gfns=1&amp;q=html5+client+storage" rel="nofollow noreferrer">client-side storage</a> supported by modern browsers like firefox and safari.</p> <p>The <a href="http://developer.yahoo.com/yui/storage/" rel="nofollow noreferrer">YUI Storage Utility</a> is a nice cross-browser wrapper around these methods.</p>
<p>You could make an Ajax call to a web service which would either save the file for you on the server or perhaps serve it back to the browser for download</p> <p>using <a href="http://jquery.com/" rel="nofollow noreferrer">jQuery</a></p> <pre> $.ajax({ type: "POST", url: "save.php", data: "name=Bob&Age=1", success: function(msg){ alert( "Data Saved: " + msg ); } }); </pre>
<p>On it's own, no.. at least without exploiting browser / plugin vulnerabilities.</p> <p>Since you clarified your question:</p> <p>It can be used to do an ajax call to a server-side script which would then write a file into the file system.</p>
<p>Javascript cannot directly write to a file on the webserver on which it is hosted. If it is required, you can use something like an XMLHttpRequest object to communicate your means to a serverside script (like PHP or Python), which will then do the write.</p> <p>Javascript code is executed on the client side. It does not directly have access to your server.</p>
<p>It depends on a platform. Some platforms (like Windows), allow javascript to access filesystem (in Windows - via FileSystemObject ActiveX object). But client's browser security settings must be adjusted to allow this.</p>
