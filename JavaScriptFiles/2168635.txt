How to add more options in Javascript dependent options?
<p>I want to add more dropdown options in this file:</p> <p><a href="http://parseven.com/java_ex.html" rel="nofollow noreferrer">http://parseven.com/java_ex.html</a></p> <p>Now it has two and I want to make three more. Third option must be dependent on second option and so on. Please advise me. Thanks in advance.</p>
<p>Where is the data coming from? I'm not sure which part of the answer you need most:</p> <ol> <li>You need to add an event handler to the OnChange event of the first dropdown.</li> <li>In the event handler, you need to get the data from somewhere (AJAX?)</li> <li>Then you need to take the new data and <a href="http://www.plus2net.com/javascript_tutorial/list-adding.php" rel="nofollow noreferrer">add it to the second dropdown</a>.</li> </ol> <p>Here is basically what you do:</p> <pre><code>document.getElementById('dropdown1').onchange = yourFunction; function yourFunction() { //Here is where you need to get the data //Then you need to add them to the other dropdown like this: var dropdown2 = document.getElementById('dropdown2'); var optn = document.createElement("OPTION"); optn.text = text; optn.value = value; dropdown2.options.add(optn); } </code></pre>
