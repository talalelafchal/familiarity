Is it possible to encrypt the password in JavaScript?
<p>I am password protecting the xl file while opening. The code is like:</p> <pre><code>myobjExcel.Worksheets(i).Protect("password"); </code></pre> <p>So this password can be seen by clicking on View -> Source</p> <p>So how can I encrypt this?</p>
<p>You can only obfuscate it. But actual encryption so that someone looking at it can't figure it out (or needs a few billion years to do so) is impossible as that only works with a secret. And the only place where you could supply such a secret would be the source code itself.</p> <p>And handing someone a ciphertext and the secret to decrypt it is equivalent to giving him the plain text.</p> <p>The only thing you can do here is make it harder for someone to see it, but it someone is determined to get the password, then they will.</p>
