Javascript alert
<p>I use alert boxes to warn the user about errors when submitting a form on a website I am working on, but each time I click the "ok" button to close the alert box, the page go back to the top and I need to scroll down again to see the form.</p> <p>I checked other website but this does not happen despite the code is pretty much the same. What is wrong?</p>
<p>I suspect you're letting the form submit still, you should have something like:</p> <pre><code>&lt;form onsubmit='return checkThings();'&gt; function checkThings () { if( somethingBad ){ return false; } return true; } </code></pre> <p>Returning false will stop the form from submitting.</p>
<p>The page jumping to the top is usually a sign that you are linking to <code>'#'</code> but not cancelling the action - I've never seen that happen on a form submit myself.</p> <p>Here's an example of something which might cause the page to jump:</p> <pre><code>// HTML &lt;a href="#" onclick="return doSomething()"&gt; // JS function doSomething() { blah(); x = 5 / 0; // divide by zero error, therefore the next line return false; // is not executed } </code></pre> <p>After the page jumps, look in the address bar. Is there a # at the end?</p> <p>Just make sure that <code>onclick</code> or <code>onsubmit</code> functions always return false if you don't want the default action to occur.</p>
