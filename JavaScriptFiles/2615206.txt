How do I make my web page work with the same layout in all browsers?
<p>I am trying to make my web page work with the same layout (height, width, etc.) in all browsers, using JavaScript. How can I do this?</p> <p>by the way i tried to use percentage value </p>
<p>I use this script quite a bit for users who use IE6 and IE7 (also works for IE8)</p> <p><a href="http://code.google.com/p/ie7-js/" rel="nofollow noreferrer">http://code.google.com/p/ie7-js/</a></p> <p>I'd combine that with a CSS reset, and you'd be in business.</p>
<p>Please read the <em>Dao of Web Design</em>, an article written in 2000. The Dao is that web design should not, nor need to, look identical in all browsers. This is not print design. I find that most designers do not understand this and spin their wheels trying to control a medium that is not meant to be controlled. Design your sites to fit within the imperfect construct rather than trying to make an imperfect medium perfect.</p> <p><a href="http://www.alistapart.com/articles/dao/" rel="nofollow noreferrer">http://www.alistapart.com/articles/dao/</a></p>
