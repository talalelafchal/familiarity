How to change cursor for the whole document (not only within the body) via JavaScript?
<p>In the way it's cross-browser, using JavaScript only.</p>
<p>I think the issue you're having is that the <code>body</code> element isn't filling the viewport because there isn't much content on the page (this is especially true on IE). You can force it to fill the viewport with CSS:</p> <pre><code>html, body { height: 100%; cursor: pointer; } </code></pre> <p>...which then ensures the cursor is a pointer anywhere in the viewport. </p> <p><em>Edit</em>: And having ensured that the <code>body</code> element fills the viewport, you can use the <code>style</code> object on the <code>document.body</code> to set the cursor from JavaScript. So to change it to a crosshair:</p> <pre><code>document.body.style.cursor = 'crosshair'; </code></pre> <p>If you can't apply CSS at all in advance, this seems to work:</p> <pre><code>document.documentElement.style.height = "100%"; document.body.style.height = "100%"; document.body.style.cursor = "pointer"; </code></pre>
