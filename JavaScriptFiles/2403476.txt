Creating Javascript function called ReadName()
<p>I want to create a form which has a text entry box where a user can enter their name and then I want a button as well. But what I want this button to have a function called ReadName() where what will happen is when the user clicks on the button it will come up with a message saying "Hello <em>user name will appear here</em> I have tried my self and but I don't think I am not getting what I want. Any help will be appreciated.</p> <pre><code>&lt;form&gt; &lt;label for="name"&gt;Name:&lt;/label&gt; &lt;input type="text" name="name" id="name"/&gt; &lt;input type="text" name="name" onfocus="ReadName()"/&gt; &lt;/form&gt; </code></pre>
<pre><code>function ReadName() { var name = document.getElementById('name').value; alert('Hello '+ name); } </code></pre>
