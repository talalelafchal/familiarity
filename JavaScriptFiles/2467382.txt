javascript alert box with radio buttons
<p>I want to create an alert box with 3 radio buttons in it. It should be like </p> <p>'Replace' 'Save' 'Merge'</p> <p>along with OK and Cancel buttons. Any idea how to achieve this?</p>
<p>There is no default javascript box that does this, you have <code>confirm()</code>, <code>prompt</code> and <code>alert</code> available and that's it.</p> <p>There are however widgetsets/libraries that give you this option. Try <a href="http://www.extjs.com/deploy/dev/examples/message-box/msg-box.html" rel="nofollow noreferrer">Ext JS</a> for example</p>
<p>use the input tag to generate radio buttons</p> <p><code>&lt;input type="radio" name="button_1"&gt;Replace&lt;/input&gt;</code></p> <p>and div tag to generate you okay and cancel buttons</p> <p><code>&lt;div id="cancel"&gt;Cancel&lt;/div&gt;</code></p> <p>and have the onclick functions of your div's be a javascript call which pulls the data out of the radio buttons.</p>
<p>To add to what WoLpH said, you specifically want a modal overlay that can be called programmatically similar to an alert box. Give <a href="http://jqueryui.com/demos/dialog/" rel="nofollow noreferrer">jQuery UI</a> or <a href="http://developer.yahoo.com/yui/3/overlay/" rel="nofollow noreferrer">YUI</a> a try. </p>
<p>You can use javascript to create modal dialog box with the controls you would like to show. You can customize the look &amp; get rid of the default grey dialog boxes, it's really cool.
