Dailymotion Javascript API problem
<p>include js file "swfobject.js" js code is as follows:</p> <pre><code>var params = { allowScriptAccess: "always" }; var atts = { id: "mydmplayer" }; swfobject.embedSWF("http://www.dailymotion.com/swf/VIDEO_ID&amp;enablejsapi=1&amp; playerapiid=dmplayer", "dmapiplayer", "425", "356", "8", null, null, params, atts); </code></pre> <p>I am newbie to javascript and SWF.</p> <p>I am using this code to embed video into my html. Now I want to create custom links like "play", "fast forward" etc.</p> <p>Could you please guide me, how to acheive this? Please reply ASAP. It's urgent.</p> <p>I would be very thankful to you.</p>
<pre><code>&lt;script&gt; function play() { mydmplayer.playVideo(); } &lt;/script&gt; &lt;a onclick="play();" &gt;Play&lt;/a&gt; </code></pre> <p>it will play the video if paused. you have to use api parameters to start video automatically. play != start.</p>
