Rich Text Editor
<p>I'd like to build a rich text editor for a web site. How would I go about this? I've heard of iframe use for such a thing. Also contentEditable set to true plays a role. Could you tell me what you know about implementing a WYSIWYG editor? It would be nice...</p>
<p>If you don't want to reinvent the wheel then you can look for some editors like</p> <p><a href="http://ckeditor.com/" rel="nofollow noreferrer">CKEditor</a></p> <p><a href="http://tinymce.moxiecode.com/" rel="nofollow noreferrer">TinyMCE</a></p> <p>which comes with a lot of features.</p>
<p>Please try some open source Rich text editor that will help you</p> <p>One I know and used is <a href="http://www.openwebware.com/" rel="nofollow noreferrer">openwebware</a> </p> <p><strong>About iframe</strong> I think every Rich text editor uses iframe. The editor above is also using iframe. </p> <p><strong>About contentEditable</strong> This is used to make a element editable in browser it self. You can find this in the editor mentioned above.</p> <p>Do try this editor will help you.</p>
<p>I built one from scratch using the Mozilla MIDAS specification. Keep in mind that this won't work well with IE (at least mine doesn't).</p> <p>Specification - <a href="http://www.mozilla.org/editor/midas-spec.html" rel="nofollow noreferrer">http://www.mozilla.org/editor/midas-spec.html</a></p> <p>Demo - <a href="http://www.mozilla.org/editor/midasdemo/" rel="nofollow noreferrer">http://www.mozilla.org/editor/midasdemo/</a></p> <p>I use the demo source (which it pretty clean) to construct my own editor for my CMS.</p> <p>Good Luck!!!!!</p>
<p>Consider saving yourself a lotta headache and look at <a href="http://tinymce.moxiecode.com/" rel="nofollow noreferrer">TinyMCE</a>, <a href="http://ckeditor.com/" rel="nofollow noreferrer">FCKEditor/CKEditor</a>, and <a href="http://cutesoft.net/" rel="nofollow noreferrer">CuteEditor</a> (commercial). My personal favorite at the moment is CKEditor - its evolved very nicely and is pretty easy to use now</p> <p>The recently released <a href="http://closure-library.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/closure/goog/docs/index.html" rel="nofollow noreferrer">Google Closure Library</a> has capability to build rich text editors as well tho I have not yet any experience with that one - dunno its limitations if any</p>
<p>If you really want to build your own then there are a few good <a href="http://www.devguru.com/features/tutorials/wysiwyg/wysiwyg1.asp" rel="nofollow noreferrer">tutorials</a> around.</p> <p>Otherwise, here are another couple of good third-party editors that haven't been mentioned yet:</p> <ul> <li><a href="http://developer.yahoo.com/yui/editor/" rel="nofollow noreferrer">YUI Rich Text Editor</a></li> <li><a href="http://www.telerik.com/products/aspnet-ajax/editor.aspx" rel="nofollow noreferrer">RadEditor</a></li> </ul>
