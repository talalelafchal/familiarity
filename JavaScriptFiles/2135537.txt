What is a good javascript editor for editing custom DSL code?
<p>I'm looking for a nice / customisable editor to put on a web page for editing scripts for a custom DSL. Ideally with syntax highlighting (and intellisense would be great! ) </p> <p>Anyone know of anything suitable?</p>
<p>You should take a look at <a href="https://bespin.mozilla.com/" rel="nofollow noreferrer" title="Bespin">Bespin</a>. You have a good description here: http:// mozillalabs.com/bespin/2010/01/15/bespin-embedded-0-6-released-now-in-two-great-flavors/ </p> <p>It has a full support for being embedded. See the embedding doc : https:// bespin.mozilla.com/docs/embedding/index.html</p> <p>You can write a custom syntax highlighting plugin pretty easily if needed. You can probably fork and adapt one of the built-in syntax highlighters. The editor itself and its plugins are written in Javascript.</p> <p>The project is aimed at being a complete web-based &amp; collaborative code editor, so intellisense-like features should make their way in soon if they're no alreay present.</p>
<p>For syntax highlighting, look at <a href="http://www.cdolivet.com/index.php?page=editArea" rel="nofollow noreferrer">EditArea</a>. Intellisense could be written as a plugin.</p>
<p>maybe you should have a look at codemirror:</p> <p><a href="http://codemirror.net/" rel="nofollow noreferrer">http://codemirror.net/</a></p> <p>it's "just" an editor-component and you will probably have to put some work into it. but it's easy to enhance and integrate it.</p>
