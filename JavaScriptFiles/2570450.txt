Read a local file
<p>Is there no way for javascript hosted on a webserver to read a file on a client's local machine? (this has obvious security risks). I guess I'm wondering if there's any access granting a user can do, like drag and dropping a file into the browser, or explicitly selecting a file from a popup to get around this?</p> <p>I know flash 10 allows reading of a local file, just wondering if there were any method to do this in javascript.</p> <p>Thanks</p>

<p>Who on their right mind would release a browser that let JS to... oh wait, you can with activeX, but only works with IE.</p>
<p><em>... or explicitly selecting a file from a popup to get around this ...</em></p> <p>You could of course just upload the file to your server then...</p>
<p>There is new File API being a working draft in W3C, and it is already implemented in Firefox 3.6, see</p> <p><a href="http://demos.hacks.mozilla.org/openweb/FileAPI/" rel="nofollow noreferrer">http://demos.hacks.mozilla.org/openweb/FileAPI/</a><br> <a href="http://ajaxian.com/archives/w3c-publish-first-working-draft-of-file-api" rel="nofollow noreferrer">http://ajaxian.com/archives/w3c-publish-first-working-draft-of-file-api</a><br> <a href="http://hacks.mozilla.org/2009/12/w3c-fileapi-in-firefox-3-6/" rel="nofollow noreferrer">http://hacks.mozilla.org/2009/12/w3c-fileapi-in-firefox-3-6/</a></p>
