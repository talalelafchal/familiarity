How to find out the dimension of the lightbox?
<p>About the lightboxes. The box adjusts its dimension to match the picture. Question is how do the box find out the size of the picture?</p>
<p>I assume something akin to:</p> <pre><code>imgWidth = $(img).width(); imgHeight = $(img).height(); </code></pre> <p>It would load the image in a hidden element (or positioned off screen), get the dimensions, animate the container to fit, then expose the image (usually via some sort of transition/animation).</p>
<p>To answer the comment about detecting when its done loading, i believe you can use the onLoad event. in jquery this would look somthing like:</p> <p><code>$('img').attr('src', 'uri/for/image').load(callbackFunction);</code></p> <p>or manually:</p> <pre><code>var tmp = new Image(); tmp.onload = callbackFunction; tmp.src = 'uri/for/image'; </code></pre> <p>your <code>callbackFunction</code> could then use <code>$(this).height()</code> and <code>$(this).height()</code> safely. so your <code>callbackFunction</code> is where you would have the actual logic to trigger the rest of your implementation.</p> <p>in alot of cases if seen this callback (or its equiv. implementation) simply set a global variable and then somewhere else in the code youll see polling of this variable every N ms. and when its set it will trigger the rest of the script.</p>
