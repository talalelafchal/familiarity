JavaScript: mouse coordinates
<p>I have two div boxes: one that is large is the parent to the other that is small. With propeties offsetX and offsetY, I find out the coorinates of the mouse pointer. I only need coordinates relative to the large box, but when the mouse pointer is over the small box, coordinates are figured out relative to this small box. How do I get coordinates relative to the large box even though the mouse pointer is over the small box?</p>
<p>I assume that is because the small box is absolutely or relatively positioned (<code>position: absolute</code> <code>position: relative</code>). Can you change that so that only the parent is absolutely positioned?</p> <p>Otherwise, the JS Frameworks should offer everything you need to convert relative into absolute positions, and correlate them to the mouse cursor.</p>
