Get selected Item from the list with JS
<p>I have an html list with some items loaded. I am able to get the select list object using the following code:</p> <pre><code>var list = document.getElementById('ddlReason'); </code></pre> <p>but I need help with figuring out how to detect which value has been chosen from the list.</p>
<pre><code>// Gets your select var list = document.getElementById('ddlReason'); // Get the index of selected item, first item 0, second item 1 etc ... var INDEX = list.selectedIndex; // Viola you're done alert(list[INDEX].value); </code></pre> <p>Edit (forgot .value).</p> <p>You can also make that a bit more concise, but I wanted to make it readable so you could see what was going on. Shorter version:</p> <pre><code>var list = document.getElementById('ddlReason'); alert(list[list.selectedIndex].value); </code></pre>
<p>The list object will have a 'options' attribute that is an array of all the options in the list and a 'selectedIndex' attribute that contains the index of the selected item (or the first selected item if there are multiple). So you can do this:</p> <pre><code>var list = document.getElementById('ddlReason'); var selectedValue = list.options[list.selectedIndex]; </code></pre>
<p>Actually you can do this</p> <pre><code>var list = document.getElementById('ddlReason').value; </code></pre> <p>and if you make an alert to <code>list</code>, you'll get the value of your select tag.</p>
