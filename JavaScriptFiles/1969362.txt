Can we fetch data from webpage using JavaScript?
<p>I have created few scripts to complete a web registration. Now each time I complete a registration on the last step it generates a 'Registration ID'. I need to capture and save this id to a file. Can we do this with JavaScript?</p>
<p>To get the registration id you can save it t a hidden element [textbox with type hidden] and get the value using javascript like this.</p> <pre><code>document.getElementById ( "txtHidRegID" ).value; </code></pre> <p>where the id of the textbox is txtHidRegID.</p> <p>For the second part [file save] you cannot access files on the client side using javascript. You can save it to a file on the server side using any server side language.</p> <p>Accessing file in a client machine using javascript which runs inside a sandbox will be a security hole.</p>
<p>Not directly with JavaScript. You will have to send your generated id to the server somehow. You could use XHR (AJAX) if you don't wish to refresh the page.</p>
<p>If you wish to save the ID to the server side, you can do that by throwing an Ajax request with the value to a server-side script which will save the value.</p> <p>If you wish to save to a local file (client-side), then you need more than JavaScript.</p> <p>To get the registration ID, use the DOM with getElementById.</p>
