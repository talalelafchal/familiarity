Some encoded Javascript that I need in plain text
<p>I'm having some issues trying to decode some javascript.. I have no idea what kind of encoding this is.. i tried base 64 decoders etc. If you can please help me out with this, here's a fragment of the code:</p> <pre><code>\x69\x6E\x6E\x65\x72\x48\x54\x4D\x4C","\x61\x70\x70\x34\x39\x34\x39\x3 </code></pre> <p>Any ways I can get plain text from that?</p> <p>Thanks!</p>
<blockquote> <p>The escape() function encodes a string.</p> <p>This function makes a string portable, so it can be transmitted across any network to any computer that supports ASCII characters.</p> <p>This function encodes special characters, with the exception of: * @ - _ + . /</p> </blockquote> <p>The reverse of <code>escape()</code> is the <code>unescape()</code> function.</p> <p>Try this:</p> <pre><code>alert(unescape("\x69\x6E\x6E\x65\x72\x48\x54\x4D\x4C\x61\x70\x70\x34\x39\x34\x39\x3")); </code></pre> <p>Edit: As J-P mentioned unescape isn't really needed here after all.</p>
<p>These are simply hex-values of symbols.</p> <p>\x69 = i, etc. First several letters: "innerHTML", "apâ€¦"</p>
<p>I think you should use <code>window.unescape()</code>, or <code>unescape()</code></p>
<p><code>\xNN</code> is an escape sequence. <code>NN</code> is a hexidecimal number (<code>00</code> to <code>FF</code>) that represents a <a href="http://www.utoronto.ca/web/HTMLdocs/NewHTML/iso_table.html" rel="nofollow noreferrer">Latin-1</a> character. </p> <p>Escape sequences are interpreted literally within a string. So:</p> <pre><code>"\x69" === "i" // true </code></pre>
