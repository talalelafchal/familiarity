Looking for a good date range picker. Any suggestions?
<p>We're building a dashboard similar to what Google Analytics has done and want a date range picker similar to theirs. Is anyone aware of an off the shelf javascript utility that can do this? I suppose we could roll our own if needed, but would love to find something ready to go. Below is an image of what Google's looks like.</p> <p><img src="http://s3.amazonaws.com/greenshipping/google_date_picker.png" alt="alt text"></p>
<p>Try this <a href="http://www.eyecon.ro/datepicker/" rel="nofollow noreferrer">jQuery plugin</a> which allows you select date range. See the last two examples on the page. </p> <p><img src="http://img510.imageshack.us/img510/4323/picture9ux.png" alt="alt text"></p> <p><img src="http://img684.imageshack.us/img684/8297/picture8x.png" alt="alt text"></p>
<p>I would recommend the <a href="http://docs.jquery.com/UI/Datepicker" rel="nofollow noreferrer">Jquery UI datepicker</a>.</p>
<p>jQueryUI datepicker is cool. <a href="http://jqueryui.com/demos/datepicker/#multiple-calendars" rel="nofollow noreferrer">http://jqueryui.com/demos/datepicker/#multiple-calendars</a></p> <p>You can modify it for ranges instead of dates.</p>
<p>Yui calendar should do. here's an example of how to deal with date intervals <a href="http://developer.yahoo.com/yui/examples/calendar/intervalcal.html" rel="nofollow noreferrer">http://developer.yahoo.com/yui/examples/calendar/intervalcal.html</a></p>
