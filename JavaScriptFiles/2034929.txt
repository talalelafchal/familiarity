JavaScript DELETE statement. Query
<p>I was just wondering if the DELETE statement is supported by all browsers e.g:</p> <pre><code>delete myObj; </code></pre> <p>I just want to make 100% sure if all browsers support this or not? Also is there any browser or maybe mobile (cell) phones that do not?</p>
<p><a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en/Core_JavaScript_1.5_Reference/Operators/Special_Operators/delete_Operator" rel="nofollow noreferrer">Mozilla's Developer Center</a> provides the following information:</p> <pre>Implemented in: JavaScript 1.2, NES3.0 ECMA Version: ECMA-262</pre> <p>So you can check your target browser against this for an idea of whether it's supported at all or not.</p> <p><em><a href="http://trilancer.wordpress.com/2009/06/10/extreme-testing-of-javascript-delete-operator-on-different-browsers/" rel="nofollow noreferrer">Extreme testing of JavaScript delete operator on different browsers</a></em> seems to suggest that nearly all major browsers do support it, just not equally well. Furthermore, the author provides an <em>extreme</em> test page for you to experiment with your browser online at <a href="http://www.trilancer.com/extreme_delete.html" rel="nofollow noreferrer">http://www.trilancer.com/extreme_delete.html</a></p> <p>I would also consider reading the following question for more details on how to property use the <code>delete</code> operator:</p> <ul> <li><a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/742623/deleting-objects-in-javascript">Deleting Objects in Javascript</a></li> </ul>
<p>To directly answer your question, as far as I am aware, any browser that supports JavaScript supports <code>delete</code>. I checked and it existed in the specification for <a href="http://www.mozilla.org/js/language/E262.pdf" rel="nofollow noreferrer">ECMAScript 1</a> (released in 1997) so it's been around for a while now.</p>
