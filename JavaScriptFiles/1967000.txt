How to convert string to date javascript?
<p>I have this as my date: 1212009 so this should be like 12/1/2009 but I am stuck this as an id field and id fields cannot have dashes in there names. </p> <p>Now can java-script take this number and re add the slashed in for me or how would I go about doing this?</p> <p>Thanks</p>
<p>Well without leading zeros, it's not possible to make a reliable conversion. It's impossible to know if 1232009 is 1/23/2009 or 12/3/2009 without leading zeros. Also, your example number could be interpreted as 1/21/2009 too.</p>
<p>All you need to do is pass the string into the new date constructor.</p> <p>Here is a good javascript resource for you to look at.</p> <p><a href="http://www.javascriptkit.com/jsref/date.shtml" rel="nofollow noreferrer"><a href="http://www.javascriptkit.com/jsref/date.shtml" rel="nofollow noreferrer">http://www.javascriptkit.com/jsref/date.shtml</a></a></p>
<p>You should have two-digit numbers for the month and day, since <code>"1212009"</code> is ambiguous, could be interpreted as <code>"1/21/2009"</code> or <code>"12/1/2009"</code>.</p> <p>If you add the leading zeros, you know that there will be always 8 digits, so you can do something like this:</p> <pre><code>var str = "12012009" var result = str.replace(/(\d{2})(\d{2})(\d{4})/, "$1/$2/$3"); // 12/01/2009 </code></pre> <p>Or </p> <pre><code>var result = str.match(/(\d{2})(\d{2})(\d{4})/).slice(1).join('/'); // 12/01/2009 </code></pre>
<p>Assuming that you add the leading zeroes to remove the ambiguity, you can format the date like so:</p> <pre><code>dateString = String(id).match(/(\d{2})(\d{2})(\d{4})/).slice(1).join('/') </code></pre>
<p>Maybe this will help you to get rid of the six or seven numbers long date (most important part is the first part):</p> <pre><code>var sDate = "1212009"; if(sDate.length == 7){ sDate = sDate.substr(0,2) + "0" + sDate.substr(2); } else if(sDate.length == 6){ sDate = "0" + sDate.substr(0,1) + "0" + sDate.substr(1); } // This part can be done with Regular Expressions, as shown in other comments var month = parseInt(sDate.substring(0,2)); var day = parseInt(sDate.substring(2,4)); var year = parseInt(sDate.substring(4)); alert(day + "/" + month + "/" year); // Will alert 12/1/2009 </code></pre> <p>However, 1232009 will always be 01/23/2009, not 12/03/2009</p> <p>112009 changes to 1/1/2009</p> <p>10102009 changes to 10/10/2009</p>
