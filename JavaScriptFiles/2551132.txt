where did the other/ come from?
<p>why some thing like this </p> <pre><code>url="http:/"+"www.pathname.com"+"/"+"anotherString"; </code></pre> <p>turns into <code>http://www.pathname.com/anotherString</code>. Notice the <code>//</code> after the http:.</p>
<p>I am not sure what you mean exactly, but if it is in the URL bar of the web-browser, then it is just correcting you. you are meant to have the two forward slashes their. Its just the way you are meant to do it.</p>
<p>As a string in your file, it does not add an extra <code>/</code> to it, but if you type that string into the browser address bar, the browser will automatically add the additional <code>/</code> to the URL to make it valid. I do believe it will do this for images and other links on the page to make them valid.</p>
<p>Its just the way urls are designed, and the way browsers interpret them.

<p>An interesting anecdote: Nokia older phones write http:/ instead of http://.</p>
