JavaScript not firing on gridview
<p>I have some JavaScript code, which needs to run against my gridview when it loads up to the page. The gridview itself is dynamically added to the page through a user control.</p> <p>To apply the script, I have written the following code, which is applied using page pre render method: `gridview1.attributes.add["onload"] = "configureGridview()";</p> <p>The JavaScript function itself is on the master page. I do have other JavaScript functions on my master, and these all work but this one!</p>
<p>You can use jQuery</p> <pre><code>$(document).ready(function() { configureGridview() }); </code></pre> <p>or simple pure HTML and Js</p> <pre><code>&lt;body onload='configureGridview()'&gt; </code></pre> <p>I highly recommend the jQuery solution since it has many benefits, like waiting for the DOM to load before running. </p>
