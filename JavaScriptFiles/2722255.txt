Javascript passing and using that function
<p>I have:</p> <pre><code>var f1 = function(a){ alert(a) } var f2 = function(data, method){ method(data) // the problem is here, // the method f1 is not called. Is there a way to call that method f1? // the method f1 might not be in this scope, the method f1 can // be in a class or like this... } f2(a, f1) </code></pre> <p>The question is: Is there a way to call that f1 from f2, from the passed method? thanks</p> <p>EDIT: this is some code I write here, but I miss to set the a. anyway the value of is 5. EDIT: yes! it was just a tiny stupid error in my original code that missed up, i set the value after calling the method. hehe</p>
<p>Yes, this should work fine. In your example however, <code>a</code> is undefined when you make the invocation. Make sure you define it; this could be the reason it's not working.</p> <p>In other words, changing your example to:</p> <pre><code>f2(42, f1); </code></pre> <p>Will alert the number 42.</p>
<p>Try running your Javascript through a debugger. You'll get a message like <code>a is not defined</code> because the call <code>f2(a, f1)</code> is trying to pass a variable named <code>a</code> but you haven't declared one. However, this code will work:</p> <pre><code>var f1 = function(a){ alert(a); } var f2 = function(data, method){ method(data); } var a = 'this is a'; f2(a, f1); // results in alert('this is a') </code></pre>
