<p>i am using html inputbox , which is inside update panel i need the cursor to be set focused on that inputbox once the page is loaded so i called a function as follows</p> <p>&lt; body onload="javascript:document.Default.UserInputTextBox.focus();" ></p> <p>but i getting the following Javascript error,</p> <p><strong>Microsoft JScript runtime error: 'document.Default.UserInputTextBox' is null or not an object</strong></p> <p>please help on this</p>
<p>I do not think it is in the best interest of accessibility to dynamically alter a user's focus prior to alerting the user of such a change. What you can do that is accessible is redirect a user to a fragment URI pointing to the id attribute of the document object in question. That way you are not having to use any JavaScript.</p> <p>So, for instance, if a user requests a page at this URI:<br> <a href="http://example.com/page.html" rel="nofollow noreferrer">http://example.com/page.html</a></p> <p>You can redirect the user with your ASP code and a HTTP 302 code to this page:<br> <a href="http://example.com/page.html#myInputIDValue" rel="nofollow noreferrer">http://example.com/page.html#myInputIDValue</a></p> <p>That would presume the input field in question had the following attribute:<br> id="myInputIDValue"</p>
<p>You've got to wait for the DOM to be ready before trying to access elements in the dom; The onload event listener can wait for the entire document to be loaded including images and css... Which might be undesirable.</p> <pre><code>&lt;head&gt; &lt;script type="text/javascript" charset="utf-8"&gt; // wait for the DOCUMENT to become ready. window.onload=function(){ walkmydog() } &lt;/script&gt; &lt;/head&gt; </code></pre> <p>Here's a detailed explanation for overcoming this sort of problem: <a href="http://www.javascriptkit.com/dhtmltutors/domready.shtml" rel="nofollow noreferrer">http://www.javascriptkit.com/dhtmltutors/domready.shtml</a></p> <p>A lot of people use javascript frameworks, like jQuery, MooTools, YUI, to overcome the browse incompatibility problems.</p>
