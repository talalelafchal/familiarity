need dynamic content on page using javascript
<p>I need this page: <a href="http://winteradagency.com/mrw/index.php" rel="nofollow noreferrer">http://winteradagency.com/mrw/index.php</a> so that when you mouseover the different small images (actually a set of them) the text below changes from text into an image (which is a larger image of the smaller one) I used to use Fireworks for that sort of thing but I'm thinking that there must be an easier way using a combination of a div tage and javascript. </p> <p>Any ideas for something simple?</p> <p>thanks!</p>

<p>The jQuery CYCLE plugin might suit your needs. It transforms a list of elements into a scrolling pane. You could simply disable automatic scrolling on initialization, and set the time between slides to 0. Then you can call the "slide number" in the callback for the mouseover event on the smaller thumbnails.</p> <p>Cycle is here: <a href="http://malsup.com/jquery/cycle/" rel="nofollow noreferrer">http://malsup.com/jquery/cycle/</a></p> <p>Your application is very similar to this example: <a href="http://malsup.com/jquery/cycle/pager3.html" rel="nofollow noreferrer">link text</a></p>
<p><a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/1948600/change-button-to-image-depending-to-text-using-jquery">This question</a> has a similiar situation (replacing an input with an image) with an answer that might work for you. Note: it uses jQuery.</p> <p>Edit: For your situation you could do something like this for each image:</p> <pre><code>$('img#id').hover( function() { ('div#id').hide().after('&lt;img src="image.jpg" /&gt;'); }, function() { ('div#id').show(); } ); </code></pre> <p>changing the 'img#id' to the id of the image and 'image.jpg' to the corresponding big image.</p>
