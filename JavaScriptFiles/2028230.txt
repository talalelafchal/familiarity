<p>I'm writting my own rich text editor in javascript</p> <p>formatBlock requires a tag-name string. I mean all the tag-name strings. </p>
<p>Despite not really knowing what you're after (see my comment), it seems that you want to know more about what is possible with the <code>execCommand</code> method. As usual, the Mozilla docs have a good reference:</p> <p><a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en/Rich-Text_Editing_in_Mozilla" rel="nofollow noreferrer">Rich-Text Editing in Mozilla</a></p> <p>Of course, this only lists the commands that Firefox understands. The list of "command identifiers" that IE supports is given <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ms533049%28VS.85%29.aspx" rel="nofollow noreferrer">here</a>.</p>
