How To Assign Value To Session Using Javascript
<p>Work on Asp.Net C# VS08 I would like to assign a value to Session using javascript. Is it possible?</p> <p>example: Session["Id"] = document.getElementById("id").value;</p>
<p>Assigning to a session variable like this isn't possible in JavaScript. Best you can do is write data to a cookie.</p> <p><a href="http://www.w3schools.com/js/js_cookies.asp" rel="nofollow noreferrer">http://www.w3schools.com/js/js_cookies.asp</a></p> <p>Otherwise if you want to communicate to the server use Ajax.</p>
<p>The session is a server-side concept; Javascript has no conception of it.</p> <p>You can make an AJAX service that sets a session value.</p> <p>However, you should probably use a cookie instead.<br> You can set cookies in Javascript using <a href="http://code.google.com/p/cookies/" rel="nofollow noreferrer">this library</a>, among others.</p>
<p>No it is not possible to do that directly with JavaScript on the client-side.</p> <p>Sessions are handled on the server-side. In general your browser would simply store a cookie which uniquely identifies a session stored on your server. When you change the value of a session variable, you are storing this on the server, and the browser cookie would be unaffected.</p> <p>You could however use JavaScript to send an <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/XMLHttpRequest" rel="nofollow noreferrer">XMLHttpRequest</a> to your ASP.NET application, which in turn changes the session variable on the server-side. Since this involves a round-trip to the server, you would have to wait for the response, to confirm that the operation succeeded.</p>
<p>No it is not possible. Session is server side object. A couple of ways to do that would be to send cookies from JavaScript and use them on the server side to assign a value to a session variable, or to make an AJAX call and set the values on the backend.</p>
