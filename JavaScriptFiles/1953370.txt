Generating dynamic content in Iframe IE 7
<p>Is it possible to generate dynamic content inside Iframe? if yes , how ? I'm having some problems with IE, thank you</p> <p><strong>UPDATE :</strong> </p> <p>I'm creating a modal window which plays video, but when I close it it remains playing in IE7 although its hidden but it firefox it stops playing as it should. So I just wanted to try with iframe, thinking maybe that will solve my problem :)</p>
<p>An <code>iframe</code> is just like any other HTML window, so yes, you can generate dynamic content. </p> <p>To create content use the normal syntax:</p> <pre><code>var div = iframe.document.createElement("div"); </code></pre> <p>Please include a description of what exact problem you face. Otherwise, we can't help much.</p> <p>[EDIT] Note that the URL of the document in the iframe must contain the same domain or the Same Origin Policy will prevent the access.</p> <p>As for your problem with the modal window: Are you saying that the window doesn't close? That sounds like a IE bug :/</p>
<p>As @Aaron already noted, you can use everything you use for normal pages in your iFrame. </p> <p>Noteworthy however is that the content in the iframe is an isolated page.<br> No code from your parent page can access anything in the iframe's page.<br> This is a security measure that prevents Evil People from showing you trusted pages with custom javascript hooks attached.</p>
