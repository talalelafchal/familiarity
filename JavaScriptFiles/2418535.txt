Automatically concat several JavaScript files in one?
<p>I have many js files, with some naming convention. If there any tool that concatenate all this files in one, so I don't need to include them all separately ?</p>
<p>Something like:</p> <pre><code>$&gt; cat file1.js file2.js ... &gt; allfiles.js </code></pre> <p>?</p>
<p>In bash:</p> <pre><code>for file in `ls *js` ; do cat "$file" &gt;&gt; outputscript.js; echo &gt;&gt; "$file"; done; </code></pre>
<p>You could look at using a JS Minifier, like:</p> <ol> <li><a href="http://code.google.com/p/minify/" rel="nofollow noreferrer">http://code.google.com/p/minify/</a></li> <li><a href="http://code.google.com/closure/compiler/" rel="nofollow noreferrer">http://code.google.com/closure/compiler/</a></li> <li><a href="http://www.crockford.com/javascript/jsmin.html" rel="nofollow noreferrer">http://www.crockford.com/javascript/jsmin.html</a></li> </ol>
<p>You might find some helpful information <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/15390/best-practices-for-managing-and-deploying-large-javascript-apps">here</a>. Several answers advocate creating multiple javascript files during development, just so developers don't go crazy scrolling through thousands of lines of code. Those files are then merged during deployment -- several approaches are suggested. Several respondents also advocate using minification, which can reduce the size of the resulting mega-file.</p>
<p>In addition to the straightforward answers like using <code>cat</code> or a minifier, you can also use <a href="http://getsprockets.org/" rel="nofollow noreferrer">Sprockets</a>, which is a JavaScript build system written in Ruby. Prototype JS uses Sprockets (in fact it Sprockets was written for Prototype).</p>
