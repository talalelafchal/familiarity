<p>How can I check whether all JavaScript functions have loaded properly on a page?</p>
<p>Use <a href="https://addons.mozilla.org/addon/1843" rel="nofollow noreferrer">firebug</a> and <a href="https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/60" rel="nofollow noreferrer">web developer toolbar</a> in firefox to check the js files loaded or not and web devloper will show errors if you have any errors in javascript function..</p>
<p>use document onload event</p> <p><a href="http://www.java2s.com/Tutorial/JavaScript/0280__Document/documentonload.htm" rel="nofollow noreferrer">link text</a></p>
<p>JavaScript blocks the browser from continuing to add elements to the DOM render elements on the screen so technically any script tag would have to be evaluated before the end of the closing BODY tag.</p> <p>The window's load event is fired after DOM is complete and after all assets (CSS, images, SCRIPT) are loaded... but only if they were added to the DOM before the load event fired. Any timers or asyncronous calls (ajax, iframes, etc) could escape this method.</p> <p>In a complicated asyncronous environment, you may have AJAX loading content or you may have timers set to lazy-load SCRIPT tags.</p> <p>There's no single answer to your question, but the window's load event is the most likely answer.</p> <p>You can always test to see if a function exists before using it</p> <pre><code>function foo(params) { /* do stuff */ } ... if(foo) { foo(); } </code></pre>
