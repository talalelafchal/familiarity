a simple problem about RegExp in Javascript
<p>I have a text:</p> <pre><code> &lt;font class="myclass"&gt;class abc&lt;/font&gt; </code></pre> <p>and i have a pattern: class now, i want to find the word "class" before "abc" but not in the <code>&lt;font class="myclass"&gt;</code> ,how could i do with RegExp in javascript? Thanks! :)</p>
<p>Darin's comment is spot on -- don't use RegEx to parse HTML.</p> <p>If, however, you have a very narrow requirement to find the word "class" immediately following a <code>&gt;</code>, here's your pattern:</p> <p><code>&gt;class</code></p> <p>There is a space at the end. If you need to capture "class" for replacement, surround it with parentheses <code>( )</code>, then use the capture group <code>\1</code>.</p> <p>This is not terribly robust, but is a start and is only applicable for a very narrow search requirement, not for any more involved parsing.</p>
<p>Sermons aside, it depends on what you can expect for sure, you can try with:</p> <pre><code>/[^y]class/ /\bclass/ /class abc/ </code></pre>
