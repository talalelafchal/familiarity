<p>is it possible to default a window size to 1280 width on websites not full screen?</p> <p>If we can default it to that size would it be a problem for people who only has their resolution set on 1024?</p>
<p>Use Javascript</p> <pre><code>window.open ("http://www.javascript-coder.com", "mywindow","resizable=1,scrollbars=1,width=1280,height=250"); </code></pre> <p>Check <a href="http://www.javascript-coder.com/window-popup/javascript-window-open.phtml" rel="nofollow noreferrer">here</a></p> <p>scrollbars=1 will take care of the 1024 screen size.</p>
