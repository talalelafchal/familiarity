run another function after preceding function has completed?
<p>if i fire up 2 functions like this:</p> <pre><code>prepare_data(); read_data(); </code></pre> <p>then i guess they are running at the same time. but as you can see function two is depending on the first one, so how can i make the latter one run after the first one is completed?</p>
<p>Javascript, and most other languages, run code sequentially.</p> <p>Therefore, they will <em>not</em> both run at the same time.</p> <p>In fact, it is not possible to run two different pieces of Javascript code at the same time. However, in many other languages, it is possible using threads.</p> <p>However, if they make AJAX calls, the corresponding server-side code called by both functions will run simultaneously.<br> To prevent that, you'll need to make the first function accept a callback parameter and pass it the second function.</p>
<p>I'm assuming the first call makes some kind of asynchronous call that the second relies upon because otherwise the two functions will execute sequentially.</p> <p>If so you need to do the second in the callback from the first. For example, in jQuery:</p> <pre><code>function prepare_data() { $("#data").load("/load_data.php", function() { read_data(); }); } </code></pre> <p>It's impossible to say how you should solve this without more information on whether you're using vanilla Javascript or a particular library. I'd strongly suggest using a library of some sort for AJAX however.</p>

<p>May be you want to call Second function after first function function to be successfully executed, if so, then you can do this by this</p> <pre><code>$('button').click(function() { function1(someVariable, function() { function2(someOtherVariable); }); }); function function1(param, callback) { alert('Now first function will be called.'); callback(); } </code></pre>
