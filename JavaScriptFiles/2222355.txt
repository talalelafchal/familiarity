<p>It is not possible to hide Javascript from the user, since their browser needs to download it to execute it. The only other option is <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Obfuscated_code" rel="nofollow noreferrer">obfuscation</a>.</p>
<p>The simple answer is no - since the browser needs to understand the javascript, then the user will be able to understand the javascript...</p>
<p>You can run your private JavaScript server side e.g. using ASP <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ms974588.aspx" rel="nofollow noreferrer">JScript.NET</a></p> <pre><code>&lt;% WebService Language="JScript" Class="MyClass" %&gt; </code></pre> <p>You can put the hidden functionality on the server and call it via AJAX in the non hidden part of the code on the client.</p> <p>you can also use</p> <pre><code>&lt;script runat="server"&gt; </code></pre> <p>or if you're not using a Microsoft platform you might consider <a href="http://www.mozilla.org/rhino/" rel="nofollow noreferrer">Mozilla Rhino</a></p>
<p>As you can take someone else's code and try to encrypt it, same goes for others who can take your code. The only solution that i think is to obfuscate your javascript code so that it becomes little difficult for others to grasp but there again there decryptors available so no real solution as of what i know has come about so far.</p> <p>I am sure these links are going to help you much though:</p> <p><a href="http://www.portaldepot.net/articles/HideCodePg2.html" rel="nofollow noreferrer">http://www.portaldepot.net/articles/HideCodePg2.html</a></p> <p><a href="http://www.15seconds.com/howto/pg000916.htm" rel="nofollow noreferrer">http://www.15seconds.com/howto/pg000916.htm</a></p>
<p>While there isn't a 100% foolproof method of doing so, there are ways of hiding the JS away from the client.</p> <p>This article may be what you are looking for: <a href="http://bytes.com/topic/javascript/insights/749685-hide-javascript-code-client" rel="nofollow noreferrer">http://bytes.com/topic/javascript/insights/749685-hide-javascript-code-client</a></p>
