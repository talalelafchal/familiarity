page transitions using javascript
<p>i saw this on a site a couple of days ago and i cant seem to find it again.</p> <p>in any case, this is what was on the site:</p> <p>the page opened regularly when you entered the url. upon clicking one of the links on the page, it "transitioned" to the next page (there was a color change). and the url in the address bar was changed to reflect that. eg: if the background was blue on site.com, when clicking on the about link, the background would change to green and the browser would show site.com/about. and so on.</p> <p>also, if the url entered was site.com/about, the bg would be green and on cliking the home page, the site would transition from green to blue and browser would show site.com</p> <p>im interested in finding out how this was done. searching on google got me the meta-refresh tag, but the ffect was much more complex and worked on all browsers.</p> <p>is there any other method out there?</p>
