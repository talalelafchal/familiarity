Swift, Symbol not found: _OBJC_CLASS_$_SCNParticleSystem
<p>I've just picking up Swift and playing around with SceneKit. I created a simple "Smoke.scnp" particle emitter in the xcode 6 editor, and I'm trying to load that using the SCNParticleSystem class. I have included the SceneKit frame work with the project. When running without the particle system, I could load the camera and other nodes just fine, but including the particle system failed during linking time. The error I got was symbol not found for SCNParticleSystem. </p> <p>I don't have much experience with SceneKit, so this may not be something specific to xcode6 or Swift. Just wondering if I have to set up anything else?</p> <p>Below is the snippet of my code:</p> <pre><code>import SceneKit import QuartzCore class GameViewController: NSViewController { @IBOutlet var gameView: GameView override func awakeFromNib(){ // create a new scene let scene = SCNScene() // Add camera to scene let cameraNode = SCNNode() cameraNode.camera = SCNCamera() scene.rootNode.addChildNode(cameraNode) // Place camera cameraNode.position = SCNVector3(x: 0, y: 0, z: 2) // Add particle emitter let bgSmokeNode = SCNNode() var particleSystem = SCNParticleSystem(named: "Smoke", inDirectory: "") bgSmokeNode.addParticleSystem(particleSystem) scene.rootNode.addChildNode(bgSmokeNode) } } </code></pre>
