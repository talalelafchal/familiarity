Converting Path Extension to Lowercase in Swift
<p>I'm trying to convert a path extension to lowercase in swift. This should be fairly easy, but when I use the obvious code, I keep getting an error:</p> <pre><code>var filePath = "/path/to/file.CSV" var fileExtension = filePath.pathExtension fileExtension.lowercaseString //ERROR happens when I try to convert to lowercase </code></pre> <p>error is the following:</p> <blockquote> <p>execution failed: error: Execution was interrupted, reason: EXC_BAD_ACCESS (code=1, address=0x0). The process has been left at the point where it was interrupted, use "thread return -x" to return to the state before expression evaluation. * thread #1: tid = 0x231209, 0x00000001083083a6, queue = 'com.apple.main-thread', stop reason = EXC_BAD_ACCESS (code=1, address=0x0) * frame #0: 0x00000001083083a6</p> </blockquote> <p>When I convert any other string to lowercase, it's completely fine.</p> <p>My workaround has been to just convert the filePath to lowercase before getting the extension, but I just wanted to know if anyone else is having this issue?</p>
<p>This is a bug for me as well, one work around is to cast the String to <code>NSString</code> like:</p> <pre><code>var filePath = "/path/to/file.CSV" var fileExtension = filePath.pathExtension (fileExtension as NSString).lowercaseString </code></pre>
<p>You can do it on this way too:</p> <pre><code>var filePath = "/path/to/file.CSV" ((filePath as NSString).pathExtension).lowercaseString </code></pre>
