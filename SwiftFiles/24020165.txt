Does Swift support string block?
<p>Languages such as Ruby and Python both support string block. Such as:</p> <pre><code>a = ''' Hello World ''' </code></pre> <p>Does Swift support string block?</p>
<p>No. As outlined in the Lexical Structure of the Swift programming language introduction, <a href="https://developer.apple.com/library/prerelease/ios/documentation/swift/conceptual/swift_programming_language/LexicalStructure.html#//apple_ref/doc/uid/TP40014097-CH30-XID_860">string literals</a> are enclosed within one single pair of quotes and must not contain newlines.</p> <p>The grammar specifies that:</p> <blockquote> <p>string-literal → " quoted-text "<br> quoted-text → quoted-text-item quoted-text opt<br> quoted-text-item → escaped-character<br> quoted-text-item → ( expression )<br> quoted-text-item → Any Unicode extended grapheme cluster except " , \ , U+000A, or U+000D<br> [...]</p> </blockquote> <p>Where U+000A and U+000D are newline and carriage return characters, respectively.</p> <p>At the moment, there is no other kind of <em>string-literal</em>.</p>
