How to stop updating location when user presses logout button in swift
I am developing a application in Swift using mapview and am fetching current location for every 3 minutes using nsstimer. I can able to fetch location and everything works fine. Sample code in my mapview controller:In view didload method let timer = NSTimer.scheduledTimerWithTimeInterval(180.0, target: self, selector: #selector(timeToMoveOn), userInfo: nil, repeats: true) func timeToMoveOn() { print(latitude) print(longitude) } It helps to fetch current location for every 3 minutes Sample code for logout action which written in another view controller:  var viewcontroller = self.storyboard?.instantiateViewControllerWithIdentifier("ViewController") as! ViewController var appDelegate:AppDelegate = (UIApplication.sharedApplication().delegate as? AppDelegate)! appDelegate.window?.rootViewController = viewcontroller appDelegate.window!.makeKeyAndVisible() It also works fine and am able to return to login page, but the PROBLEM is when I tapped logout action that func timeToMoveOn is keep on updating current location I don't want to update location when the user tapped logout action. How to stop NSTimer? I have searched other Stack Overflow answers and that does not support me because my nstimer and logout action are performing in different controllers. Can someone help me out to solve this problem?
Logout_Button Clicked_Event click time call that NSTimer method of other mapview controller : var MapVC:mapviewcontrolle = mapviewcontrolle() // diffrent view controller object MapVC.timer.invalidate()
