Swift NSTimer is crashing my program with EXC_BAD_ACCESS
iOS Noob here - I am trying to run a background Timer in Swift. The below code generates this error message: Thread 1: EXC_BAD_ACCESS (code=1, address=0xd) It has something to do with userInfo and I've also tried using nil but no success. @IBAction func startButton(_ sender: AnyObject) { timer = Timer.scheduledTimer ( timeInterval: 0.01, target: Any.self, selector: #selector(ViewController.whileRunning), userInfo: Any?.self, repeats: true ) } Reading the following documentation was not helpful: https://developer.apple.com/reference/foundation/timer/1412416-scheduledtimer#discussion The whole point of this is to move an element around my storyboard over time using the x coordinates.
