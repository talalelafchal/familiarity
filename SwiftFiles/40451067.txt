How to pass UIViewController to another class in Swift?
How to pass UIViewController to another class in Swift? I have SomeViewController class: class RidingViewController: UIViewController { fileprivate let header = RidingViewHeader(controller: self) override func viewDidLoad() { super.viewDidLoad() header.setNavigationBar() } ... } And I want to separate some code and to set up its header in the another class. I've created this class class RidingViewHeader { var controller: UIViewController let navigationBar= UINavigationBar() let navigationItem = UINavigationItem() init(controller: UIViewController) { self.controller = controller } ... } In this case I get an error: Cannot convert value of type '(NSObject) -> () -> UIViewController' to expected argument type 'UIViewController' What is the better way of doing it?
You can't access self until the view controller has been initialized. You could make it a lazy variable: fileprivate lazy var header: RidingViewHeader = { return RidingViewHeader(controller: self) }()
