OSX Swift: Editor placeholder in sourcefile error on NSTextView
I keep getting the 'Editor placeholder in sourcefile' error. I am trying to access the text of my NSTextView but I don't seem to be doing it right. @IBAction func cancelButton(sender: AnyObject) { dismissViewController(self) } @IBAction func saveButtonHandler(sender: AnyObject) { let Name: String! = nameField.stringValue; let Time: String! = timeField.stringValue; let Yum: String! = yumField.stringValue; let Instruct = (instructionField.textStorage as NSAttributedString!).string; let recipe = Recipe(name: Name, time: Time, yum: Yum, type: foodType, instructions: Instruct) dismissViewController(self) } The problem comes from the line  let Instruct = (instructionField.textStorage as NSAttributedString!).string; What am I doing wrong?
First off, if you are using Storyboards or xibs, you can't have an Outlet to an NSTextView. The workaround is to create an Outlet to the target text view's containing NSScrollView. So make sure you keep references to instructionField as such and it's containing scroll view as such: @IBOutlet weak var scrollView : NSScrollView! var instructionField : NSTextView { get { return scrollView.contentView.documentView as! NSTextView } } Next, you do not access the text contained in a text view with textStorage. The correct implementation for getting the text contained in instructionField is as follows: instructionField.string which is of type String?. Now, if you want to get an NSAttributedString from instructionField, you could do it like so to avoid forcibly unwrapping an optional: guard let str = instructionField.string else { /* else */ } guard let attrStr = str as? NSAttributedString else { /* else */ } Finally A final fix for your problem line could look something like the following: guard let Instruct = instructionField.string else { /* else */ }
