We cannot use place holder shorcut in Playground file yet
<p>It looks like a kind of bug. I tried practicing swift-language on playground.<br> But place holder shortcut(ctrl+slash) cannot be used in playground yet. </p> <p>Then I searched the solution to solve this problem. But failed. It is working very well in other swift files. </p> <p>Anybody know why cannot or any solution? </p>
<p>It would appear that this functionality is not yet implemented/hooked up. Don't expect Playgrounds to be a fully working and/or stable feature at this point. They are a new feature in a pre-release version of Xcode. They are going to have problems.</p> <p>A workaround for this is to just press tab. That will jump to the next placeholder.</p> <p>Hope this helps!</p>
