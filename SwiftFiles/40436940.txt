Different colors for bars in BarChart depend on value
How can I change the color of a single bar, dependent on its value, in a bar chart? For example: I have five different values (= five different bars) in my bar chart. All bars that have a value less than 30 should be red, all bars between 30 and 70 orange, and all bars above 70 should be green.
Their API also comes with some predefined color templates you can use to set different colors for the data set. They include: ChartColorTemplates.liberty() ChartColorTemplates.joyful() ChartColorTemplates.pastel() ChartColorTemplates.colorful() ChartColorTemplates.vordiplom() You can use them this way : chartDataSet.colors = ChartColorTemplates.colorful() Reference : https://www.appcoda.com/ios-charts-api-tutorial/
In ios-charts, the colors of the bars are set in an array. If your dataset is called barChartDataset, for example, you would set the colors like this barChartDataset.colors = [UIColor.red,UIColor.orange,UIColor.green,UIColor.black,UIColor.blue] The bars will have these colors in this order and will repeat. So if you have 10 bars, you would have 2 red bars etc. In your case, you just have to write a function to return the right color value, and attach it to the array. Reference the code below. func setColor(value: Double) -> UIColor{ if(value < 30){ return UIColor.red } else if(value <= 70 && value >= 30){ return UIColor.orange } else if(value > 70){ return UIColor.green } else { //In case anything goes wrong return UIColor.black } } And then wherever you are setting the chart use  barChartDataset.colors = [setColor(barOneValue),setColor(barTwoValue),setColor(barThreeValue),setColor(barFourValue),setColor(barFiveValue)] Hope this helps!
