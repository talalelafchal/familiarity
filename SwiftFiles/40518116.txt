SplitView Controller displays blank Detail Page First
I am working on a Master-Detail app that checks if the user is logged in in the AppDelegate under didFinishLaunchingWithOptions. If the user is not logged in, a login page is displayed. Everything works fine until I try to return from the login page to the MasterView Controller. Instead of displaying the MasterView Controller an empty DetailView Controller is displayed instead. If I click Back button then the correct MasterView Controller is displayed with all the data. I have the following code for the IBAction that should return the user to Master page:  @IBAction func goHome(sender: AnyObject) { let storyboard = UIStoryboard(name: "Main", bundle: nil) let splitViewController = storyboard.instantiateViewControllerWithIdentifier("SplitViewControllerMaster") as! UISplitViewController let appDelegate = UIApplication.sharedApplication().delegate as! AppDelegate appDelegate.window?.rootViewController = splitViewController } Would anybody have any suggestions?
