NSWidgetExtensionContext openURL Swift
I have been attempting to implement a button to open my iOS app from its widget. I realize this issue has been beaten to death on the forums but I cannot find explanation with the specific error I am receiving. Perhaps some of you more experienced iOS developers can shed some light on this. I am developing an update to one of my iOS apps for iOS 10 using XCode 8.1 and Swift 2. Code for my widget's button: URL scheme added to the widget's info.plist: The runtime error I receive when pressing the OpenApp button: AppWidget[11872:3577323] __55-[_NCWidgetExtensionContext openURL:completionHandler:]_block_invoke failed: Error Domain=NSOSStatusErrorDomain Code=-10814 "(null)" // Note: app name has been substituted with appropriate generics.
