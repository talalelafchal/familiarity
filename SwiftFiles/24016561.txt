Is .playground a swift file? Who can 'see' it?
<p>I'm trying to figure out what .playground file really is. If it's a source file, it cannot (as far as I've tried) be seen by other swift files in the project, nor other .playground files or vice versa.</p> <p>Is a project supposed to have one such file? Are they a kind of swift file?</p> <p>I know what it (.playground file) does, I just can't figure out how it fits in the project. </p>
<p>A .playground file is actually a bundle directory, which can be verified by right clicking it and selecting "Show Package Contents".</p> <p>It includes a .swift file for the actual source code, which can be edited normally , as well as a .xcplayground file and a .xctimeline file, which are opaque and can't be edited through normal means.</p> <p>You can also add files to it, such as images and other resources to use inside your playground.</p> <p>It's not necessary to be present in application projects. It's used solely as a place to explore, without the need to create a project.</p>
<p>It is not a file. It is a bundle - directory.</p> <p>It contains:</p> <ul> <li>timeline.xctimeline </li> <li>section-1.swif</li> <li>contents.xcplayground</li> </ul>
<p>My understanding is that it's purely abstract. It's a place to go and test out new apis/logic before you integrate it into your project. It's not meant to be part of your app. </p>
