UITableViewCell UI Testing
I am trying to check the background colour of an UIImageView I have in a custom UITableViewCell in UI tests. I have tried looking online everywhere but can't seem to find an actual answer to doing this. Is this possible?
I reviewed the XCUIElement Class Reference. The ability to observe colors aren't exposed to us for functional testing. Refer to this link, which provides an alternative to your situation. I know this isn't the answer you're looking for, but I hope it helps.
