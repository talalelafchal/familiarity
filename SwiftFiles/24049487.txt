How do you retrieve the type of an object in Swift?
<p>I cannot seem to find a function or method that returns the type of an object in Swift.</p> <p>How does one retrieve the type or class of an object in Swift?</p> <p>I tried using Obj-C classes which obviously did not work.</p> <p>In python you have things like <code>type</code> or <code>isinstance</code></p> <p>In Javascript you have <code>constructor</code></p>
<p>If you just need to check an object's type, you can use the <em>type check operator</em>, <code>is</code>, as in:</p> <pre><code>if myObject is UIView { // do something } </code></pre> <p>If you want to try to call a method on the object but you aren't sure of the class, <em>downcast</em> the object to the type you need, like this:</p> <pre><code>if let myView = myObject as? UIView { myView.layer.backgroundColor = myColor } </code></pre>
<p>Are you looking for <code>dynamicType</code>?</p> <pre><code>someInstance.dynamicType.printClassName() </code></pre>
