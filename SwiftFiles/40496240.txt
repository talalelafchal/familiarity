Adding UIView to CollectionviewCell weird behavior, inspector shows correct, device doesn't
I'm trying to add a subview in a uicollectionview but it's not moving to the background, however when opening the inspector it shows up as it should. While building the cell I add a UIView to the cell in cellForItemAtIndexPath. Function in cell's class that adds the view to the cell: internal func addView(viewToAdd:UIView){ viewToAdd.frame = CGRectMake(0, 0, self.frame.width, self.frame.height) self.addSubview(viewToAdd) } I want to add following view: let newView = NSBundle.mainBundle().loadNibNamed("t1y1x1", owner: 0, options: nil)[0] as! t1y1x1 tmp.image01.af_setImageWithURL(NSURL(string: coupon.images[0].url)!) tmp.image02.af_setImageWithURL(NSURL(string: coupon.images[1].url)!) tmp.image03.af_setImageWithURL(NSURL(string: coupon.images[2].url)!) I've tried sendSubviewToBack, this fixes the problem on the device but has weird behavior when scrolling. When cells becoms visible, The view added to the cell from a previous cell appeared instead of the correct view, after debugging the code everything seems fine. I think this has something to do with dequeing Reusable Cells. The app shows this: The inspector shows this
