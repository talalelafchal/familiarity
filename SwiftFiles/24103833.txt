swift auto completion not working in Xcode6-Beta
<p>I made an iOS project with Swift and the XCode6-Beta doesn't show any completion for me. But it works with playground.</p> <p>I noticed some youtube <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tq0nkr9nhyk" rel="nofollow">videos</a> for swift , the xCode can show the methods automatically, should I configure the project or do something else?</p> <p>Thanks. </p>
<p>I have figured it out. If your swift files contain Unicode characters, auto completion will fail even if the characters are comments. So just delete all the Unicode characters, and the auto completion feature will work well !</p> <p>I　think this is a Xcode6-Beta bug !</p>
<p>Not even use as comments,it would lost auto completion if you use Unicode Characters as parameters.<br> Such as <code>sender.setTitle("A♣︎", forState: UIControlState.Normal)</code><br> you have to delete all Unicode characters.<br> it's really inconvenient.Hope it would be fixed in next version. </p>
