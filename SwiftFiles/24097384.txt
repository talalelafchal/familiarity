NSURLConnection crashing the app
<p>I am downloading Json data from server using NSURLConnection class. I parse the data in background thread, however in <code>connection() delegate method the app is crashing</code>. Below is the screenshot. The code is also available in the image below. Why is this happening?</p> <p>Regards</p> <p><img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/0SSO2.png" alt="enter image description here"></p> <p><strong>UPDATE:</strong></p> <p>With breakpoints removed:</p> <p><img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/0jBe6.png" alt="enter image description here"></p>
<p>It seems that you are trying to use <code>UIAlertView</code> and that is causing a crash. Now, from your code is not clear how you are doing that. In any case <code>UIAlertView</code> is deprecated under iOS 8 and this might explain the issue when using Swift (although using deprecated methods or classes does not usually causes a crash in Obj-C).</p> <p>You could try with a <code>UIAlertController</code> and set its <code>preferredStyle</code> to <code>UIAlertControllerStyleAlert</code>:</p> <pre><code>var alert = UIAlertController(title: "Title", message: "Message", preferredStyle: UIAlertControllerStyle.Alert) alert.addAction(UIAlertAction(title: "Ok", style: UIAlertActionStyle.Default, handler: nil)) self.presentViewController(alert, animated: true, completion: nil) </code></pre>
