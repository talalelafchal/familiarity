Support iOS 8 - Swift
<p>Do I need to learn and convert my entire codebase to the new Swift language if I want to support ios 8? </p>
<p>NO. Your Swift code can be run alongside your Objective-C code because Swift is built with the same compiler, ARC management and runtime as Objective-C.</p>
<p><strong>No.</strong> The APIs available from Swift are exactly the same as the APIs available from Objective-C; you can code against any iOS 8 APIs from either language.</p> <p>To start writing in Swift, there's an option called <a href="https://developer.apple.com/library/prerelease/ios/documentation/Swift/Conceptual/BuildingCocoaApps/Migration.html" rel="nofollow">Migration.</a> It will convert your existing code into swift code </p> <blockquote> <p>Migration provides an opportunity to revisit an existing Objective-C app and improve its architecture, logic, and performance by replacing pieces of it in Swift. For a straightforward, incremental migration of an app, you’ll be using the tools learned earlier—mix and match plus interoperability. Mix-and-match functionality makes it easy to choose which features and functionality to implement in Swift, and which to leave in Objective-C.</p> </blockquote>
