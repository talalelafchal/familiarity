Overloading &quot;.&quot; produces errors
<p>I can't seem to overload "." and not sure if it's a compiler bug or something I'm doing:</p> <pre><code>@infix func . (a: Int, b: Int) -&gt; Int { return a * b } </code></pre> <p>I get the errors:</p> <p><code>Expected identifier in function declaration Braced block of statements is an unused closure</code></p>
<p>You can't overload '.' It's a reserved token for the language. You can however overload the .. and ... operators.</p> <blockquote> <p>Operators are made up of one or more of the following characters: /, =, -, +, !, <em>, %, &lt;, >, &amp;, |, ^, ~, and .. That said, the tokens =, ->, //, /</em>, */, ., and the unary prefix operator &amp; are reserved. These tokens can’t be overloaded, nor can they be used to define custom operators.</p> </blockquote> <p><a href="https://developer.apple.com/library/prerelease/ios/documentation/Swift/Conceptual/Swift_Programming_Language/LexicalStructure.html#//apple_ref/doc/uid/TP40014097-CH30-XID_794">Language Reference</a></p>
<p>Swift does allow the definition and overload of custom operators, but it only allows <a href="https://developer.apple.com/library/prerelease/ios/documentation/Swift/Conceptual/Swift_Programming_Language/LexicalStructure.html#//apple_ref/doc/uid/TP40014097-CH30-XID_871" rel="nofollow">certain characters</a> to be considered operators.</p> <blockquote> <p>Operators are made up of one or more of the following characters: /, =, -, +, !, *, %, &lt;, >, &amp;, |, ^, ~, and .. <strong>That said, the tokens =, ->, //, /*, */, ., and the unary prefix operator &amp; are reserved.</strong> These tokens can’t be overloaded, nor can they be used to define custom operators.</p> </blockquote> <p>It is therefore illegal to try to overload the period operator, though it can be used as part of another custom operator.</p>
