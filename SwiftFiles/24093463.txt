Firebase with Swift
<p>I was attempting to port the <code>firechat-ios</code> project over to Swift and ran into some issues. I suppose this might just be requiring the firebase folks to make some update to their SDK, but I figured I would ask anyway. I wasn't able to successfully build my project after adding Firebase and its dependencies.</p> <p>I get a warning:</p> <pre><code>ignoring file /Users/n/Projects/SwiftChat/Firebase.framework/Firebase, missing required architecture x86_64 in file /Users/n/Projects/SwiftChat/Firebase.framework/Firebase (3 slices) </code></pre> <p>and two errors:</p> <blockquote> <p>"_OBJC_CLASS_$_Firebase", referenced from: __TFC9SwiftChat14ViewControllercfMS0_FT7nibNameGSQSS_6bundleGSQCSo8NSBundle__S0_ in ViewController.o</p> </blockquote> <p>And</p> <blockquote> <p>linker command failed with exit code 1 (use -v to see invocation)</p> </blockquote> <p>any ideas?</p>
<p>You could try temporarily removing arm64 under Projects: Build Settings: Valid Architectures.</p> <p>This should not be considered a permanent solution, but may get you going until Firebase update their SDK.</p>
<p>I managed to get it working. It turns out that the video on the firebase website which explains which dependencies to include was out of date. I read further down the page and saw that firebase actually needs two dependencies that I was missing. After adding <code>libc++.dylib</code>, <code>libiucore.dylib</code>, <code>CFNetwork.framework</code>, <code>Security.framework</code> and <code>SystemConfiguration.framework</code> everything worked fine.</p>
