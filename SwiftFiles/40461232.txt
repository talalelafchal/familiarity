How to place draggable object in a center of a target object
I have one UIView which is a target and one UIImage which is a draggable object. The task is to place UIImage inside UIView if it's touching it. Here is my code: override func touchesEnded(_ touches: Set<UITouch>, with event: UIEvent?) { if let touch = touches.first, let target = dropTarget { let position = touch.location(in: self.superview) let isOnTarget = target.frame.contains(position) if isOnTarget { NotificationCenter.default.post(Notification(name: Notification.Name(rawValue:"onTarget"))) // Make it stay there let targetHeight = target.frame.size.height let targetWidth = target.frame.size.width self.center = CGPoint(x: targetHeight, y: targetWidth) } else { self.center = originalPosition } } } The problem with this code is that UIImage attaches at the bottom left corner, outside UIView and it should be in a center of it. How can I make it stay in the middle of target if it's touching it?
Try: self.center = CGPoint(x: targetHeight/2, y: targetWidth/2)
