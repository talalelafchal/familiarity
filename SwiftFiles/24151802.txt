How to make UITextField appear with Swift Code
<p>I want to make the following UITextField appear when I compile and run the application. I have the UITextField declared and initialised as:</p> <pre><code>var myTextField: UITextField = UITextField(frame: CGRect(x: 0, y: 0, width: 200.00, height: 40.00)); </code></pre> <p>However when I run the app, this text field does not appear. What Swift code would make the textfield appear? </p>
<p>You need to add this <code>UITextField</code> as a subview of another <code>UIView</code>.</p> <p>Assuming you are inside a <code>UIViewController</code>, you could call <code>self.view.addSubview(myTextField)</code>.</p>
<p>You have to actually add the text field to the view hierarchy, which is done slightly differently depending on the class that you're in. If for example, you're in a UIViewController subclass, you add it as a subview of the UIView attached to the view controller's view property.</p> <pre><code>var myTextField: UITextField = UITextField(frame: CGRect(x: 0, y: 0, width: 200.00, height: 40.00)); self.view.addSubview(myTextField) </code></pre> <p>Or, if you're working with a subclass of UIView, you could use:</p> <pre><code>self.addSubview(myTextField) </code></pre> <p>After you've added your text field to the view hierarchy, it's still possible that you won't be able to see it. By default, text field will have a white background color, no text, and no border around it. This can all be changed through use of the following properties.</p> <pre><code>myTextField.backgroundColor = UIColor.redColor() myTextField.text = "some string" myTextField.borderStyle = UITextBorderStyle.Line </code></pre>
