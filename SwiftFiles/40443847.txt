Best Approach for Send Value for Swift
I don't have any problem about sending values between View Controllers, but I don't like my approach for this, I use prepareForSegue method to send values between View Controllers but today I realized something and I didn't like it. Lets think about this, If I have 3 View Controllers and I fetched some values from somewhere on Internet like Parse.com in First View Controller which is in Array of someObjects, I have to reuse this array of someObjects in Third View Controller because I don't want to refetch objects on Network. I used prepareForSegue method for passing value to Second View Controller and after that I used again this approach to pass value Third View Contoller and I realized What if I have 10 View Controller or more ? What is the best approach in this case ? How can I store the values in Global Property ? Thank you !
