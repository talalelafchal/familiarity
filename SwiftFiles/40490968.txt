iMessage Extension - I can not interact with UICollectionView until I try to swipe to another app and then come back
The view is loaded, cells are shown, everything looks fine, but when i click on a cell, or try to scroll down, nothing happens. When I swipe to the left or right and try to switch to another app, the view becomes responsive and reacts to touches and scroll. I don't have to switch to another app completely, just swipe (drag) my app view a little to the left or right, and the collection view becomes responsive. Any ideas? :) Thanks
I see this when debugging, but not standalone. The simulator is the worst offender, but it happens on-device as well. If debugging, I've noticed the extension becomes usable when the memory resource gauge in Xcode is populated. Until then everything seems frozen.
