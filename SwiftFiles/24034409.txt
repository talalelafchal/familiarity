How to import existing Objective C classes in Swift
<p>I had been messing around with Swift for a while in XCode 6.0 DP to use it in my existing project. I am trying to access MyModel.h(My existing Objective C Model object) from my ViewController.swift file. I wanted to import</p> <p><code>#import "MyModel.h"</code> to my Swift file. But I could not find how this can be done. </p>
<p>In <a href="https://developer.apple.com/library/prerelease/ios/documentation/Swift/Conceptual/BuildingCocoaApps/MixandMatch.html" rel="nofollow noreferrer">Document said in to swift programming</a> There are no import statement.</p> <p><img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/2PcLM.png" alt="enter image description here"></p>
<p>Posting the answer if it helps some one facing the same issue.</p> <p>I found that a pretty straight forward solution for How to do this is given in the iOS Developer Library â€” Pre-Release. Please refer to the following link:</p> <p><a href="https://developer.apple.com/library/prerelease/ios/documentation/Swift/Conceptual/BuildingCocoaApps/MixandMatch.html#//apple_ref/doc/uid/TP40014216-CH10-XID_75">https://developer.apple.com/library/prerelease/ios/documentation/Swift/Conceptual/BuildingCocoaApps/MixandMatch.html#//apple_ref/doc/uid/TP40014216-CH10-XID_75</a></p> <p>Apple Doc says:</p> <blockquote> <p>To import a set of Objective-C files in the same app target as your Swift code, you rely on an Objective-C bridging header to expose those files to Swift. Xcode offers to create this header file when you add a Swift file to an existing Objective-C app, or an Objective-C file to an existing Swift app.</p> </blockquote> <p>So I created <code>MyApp-Bridging-Header.h</code> file and just added the following line:</p> <pre><code>#import "MyModel.h" </code></pre> <p>Now it lets me use the model in my <code>ViewController.swift</code> as follows:</p> <pre><code>var myModel = MyModel() myModel.name = "My name" myModel.dobString = "11 March,2013" println ("my model values: Name: \myModel.name and dob: \myModel.dobString") </code></pre> <p>FYI to anyone who is trying to figure this out. If you have to create the bridging file from scratch, you also have to specify a path to it in Build Settings > Swift Compiler > Objective-C Bridging Header.</p>
<p>To import into Swift app or in Objective C app that is creating a mixed-language app you need to create a bridging header you can refer <a href="https://developer.apple.com/library/prerelease/ios/documentation/Swift/Conceptual/BuildingCocoaApps/MixandMatch.html#//apple_ref/doc/uid/TP40014216-CH10-XID_78" rel="nofollow">Apple Docs</a> </p> <p>Its says</p> <blockquote> <p>Objective-C and Swift files can coexist in a single project, whether the project was originally an Objective-C or Swift project. You can simply add a file of the other language directly to an existing project. This natural workflow makes creating mixed-language app and framework targets as straightforward as creating an app or framework target written in a single language.</p> <p>To import a set of Objective-C files in the same app target as your Swift code, you rely on an Objective-C bridging header to expose those files to Swift. Xcode offers to create this header file when you add a Swift file to an existing Objective-C app, or an Objective-C file to an existing Swift app.</p> </blockquote> <p>EDIT: I have created a code for your help you can find it <a href="https://github.com/rohity821/ObjCWithSwiftCode" rel="nofollow">here</a></p>
