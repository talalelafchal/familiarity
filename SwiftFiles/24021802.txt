How are private properties used in the Swift language?
<p>It seems that there is not a private, or for that matter public, keyword in swift language. So it is possible at all to have a private property?</p> <p>On a side note, Swift is very much similar to Typescript per my observation so far.</p>
<p>Update:</p> <p>As of Xcode 6 beta 4, Swift has Access Control - <a href="https://developer.apple.com/swift/blog/?id=5">https://developer.apple.com/swift/blog/?id=5</a></p> <hr> <p>Swift doesn't have access modifiers yet. But <a href="https://devforums.apple.com/thread/227288">there are plans to add them in the future</a></p> <p>There are also some workarounds mentioned in the above linked thread, like using nested classes:</p> <pre><code>import Foundation class KSPoint { /*! * Inner class to hide the helper functions from codesense. */ class _KSPointInner { class func distance(point p1 : KSPoint, toPoint p2 : KSPoint) -&gt; Double { return sqrt(pow(Double(p2.x - p1.x), 2) + pow(Double(p2.y - p1.y), 2)) } } var x : Int var y : Int init(x : Int = 0, y : Int = 0) { self.x = x self.y = y } func distance(point : KSPoint, toPoint : KSPoint) -&gt; Double { return _KSPointInner.distance(point: point, toPoint: toPoint) } } </code></pre>
