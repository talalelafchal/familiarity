Using JSON wire protocol with ChromeDriver on Swift
I need to start a ChromeDriver session, then navigate to a URL and locate a few Web Elements on the page. Everything has to done using Swift programming language. Since there is no WebDriver library on Swift, I'm thinking of using JSON wire protocol for that. The things I'm trying to figure out: How to start a ChromeDriver session with Swift. Since I'm new to programming in Swift and haven't used JSON wire protocol before, I'm seeking help on how to send HTTP requests to ChromeDriver to locate WebElements and perform different actions on them using Swift.
