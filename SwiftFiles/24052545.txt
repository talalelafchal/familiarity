<p>According to @ThePaddedCell, I did the following steps, it's finally worked for me</p> <p>1) <code>Move</code> xcode6-beta into application folder</p> <p>2) <code>Restart</code> mac and open xcode6-beta from application folder.</p> <p>but I don't know why.. If anyone know this reason, welcome to update my answer. </p>
<p>Move your Xcode to Application then Check it if still problem is not solved then restart your Mac and open the xcode from the application.</p>
<p>This fixes the Interface Builder issue.</p> <pre><code>cd /Applications/Xcode.app cd Contents/Developer/Platforms/iPhoneSimulator.platform cd Developer/SDKs/iPhoneSimulator.sdk/usr/lib sudo mv dyld_sim dyld_sim.orig </code></pre>
