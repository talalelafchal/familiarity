IOS Swift debugging in Xcode/AppCode - I can't look in to my dictionary contents
If I put a simple dictionary such as this in my Xcode project: var myDictionary:[String: String] = [ "a": "line 1", "b": "line 2"] I would expect to be able to look browse the contents of the dictionary when I'm debugging in Xcode. However what Xcode tells me is: ﻿﻿myDictionary [String : String] 0 key/value pairs There is the option to "Print Description" when I right click however this is not exactly what I need. Ideally I would be able to view the contents in the foldable tree structure you typically get from debugging, whereas this will spit the entire contents out on the page Also I prefer to use Jetbrains AppCode for building my projects and from what I can see there is no "Print Description" there. If I'm wrong on this and if anyone can point me to one I would appreciate it
I've solved this myself now (for the most part). It only happens when I debug using the iPhone 5 in the simulator. If I even move up to iPhone 5s the debugger works as I would expect. This still leaves a bug where you can't debug properly on an iPhone 5 but this is not an issue for me and is something that i imagine Apple themselves would need to think about rather than me
