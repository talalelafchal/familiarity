Complex numbers in Swift?
<p>Does Apple's Swift language support complex numbers out of the box?</p> <p>I couldn't find any mention in the docs any equivalent for C++ <code>std::complex</code> nor could I find one when playing with it.</p>
<p>No. You may import the <code>Accelerate</code> module via <code>import Accelerate</code> and use the <code>DSPComplex</code> type. Refer to the <a href="https://developer.apple.com/library/prerelease/mac/documentation/Accelerate/Reference/vDSPRef/index.html" rel="nofollow">documentation</a> for more detail.</p>
<p>I wrote the following:</p> <p><a href="https://github.com/dankogai/swift-complex">https://github.com/dankogai/swift-complex</a></p> <p>Just add complex.swift to your project and you can go like:</p> <pre><code>let z = 1-1.i </code></pre> <p>It has all functions and operators that of C++11 covers.</p> <p>Unlike C++11 complex.swift is not generic -- z.real and z.imag are always Double.</p> <p>But the necessity for complex integer is very moot and IMHO it should be treated in different type (<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gaussian_integer">GaussianInteger</a>, maybe).</p>
