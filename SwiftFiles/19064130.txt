After review application behaviour is Strange why?
<p>I don't know why app is not responding if I download reviewed app from app store. But when the same app code which I run locally from my system it's work perfectly here I explain you in brief.</p> <p>Actually I have an registration page in which we take following things from user </p> <ul> <li>Name</li> <li>number</li> <li>Email</li> <li>Address and</li> <li>device id</li> </ul> <p>and sending all things on server but and it's work perfect on my end when download the review app it's always <code>return 0</code> that means server not responding. I am not able to understand why it's happening? I am testing my app on both simulator and iPhone after I upload it.</p> <p>Can any one tell why is this happening?</p>
<p>Like other answers, you can run your app in release mode before submitting for app review. One specific setting difference between debug mode and release mode by default is the Optimization level setting. For the debug mode, it is set to none and for the release mode it is set to smallest, fastest. You can change your debug mode's setting to smallest,fastest. I recently encountered the same situation. That was what I did. </p>
<p>I can not locate your specific problem as we need to see the code, and it is strange that Apple did not reject your app. <strong>BUT</strong> - </p> <p><strong>Always check your app after archiving it and don't count only on your debug builds.</strong></p> <p>I had the same issue with app that was rejected by apple on a crash that did not accrue on debug. When I installed the archived version I saw the crash immediately. Apparently there are some changes between the debug version and the archived version. The code is processed differently and new bugs might pop up.</p> <p>All you need to do is to archive your app with Ad-hoc provisioning and install it on your device to check if it behave the same. (It might not be your problem but you can give it a try).</p> <p>You can use <a href="http://www.charlesproxy.com" rel="nofollow">Charles</a> to check your request on the archived version and see what is going wrong.</p>
<p>First of all, the review process doesn't change your binary at all. Whatever you submit, is what you get on the store, if approved.</p> <p>Keep in mind that when you archive your application for the submission, you use the <code>Release</code> configuration, whereas typically you test on your Simulator/device with a <code>Debug</code> configuration.</p> <p>To test the actual binary on your device before sending it to the store, you have to change the Target schemes such that the Run option uses the <code>Release</code> build configuration.</p>
