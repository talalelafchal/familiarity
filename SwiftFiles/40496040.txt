specifiy a path to ipa file in xcode ui test
I started using XCode 8 for iOS 10 apps ui test automation. I am new to this IDE. Though I found lot of examples to get started with launching apps in xcode editor , is there way I can specify the .ipa path to the swift code ? I know if we add ui test to dev project workspace it can launch the app.But I want to write tests manually without using recording and I usually get only ipa file not the dev project. I have copied some code below but I don't see an option to specify the ipa file path or device /simulator to use , version to target etc.. class MyFirstUITest : XCTestCase { let app:XCUIApplication = XCUIApplication() app.launch() ?????? // some UI elements that i want to capture for tests let username = XCUIApplication().textFields["Username"] let password = XCUIApplication().secureTextFields["Password"] .... }
