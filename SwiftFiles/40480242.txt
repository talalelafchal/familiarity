remote notification issue swift 3
I have an app that receives push notification but I have a doubt: when app is in foreground and comes a remote notification I handle it but this method in AppDelegate: func application(_ application: UIApplication, didReceiveRemoteNotification userInfo: [AnyHashable : Any], fetchCompletionHandler completionHandler: @escaping (UIBackgroundFetchResult) -> Void) but I don't understand how do I have to handle the remote notification when comes a remote notification when app is in background and the user tap on rectangle of notification and then app opens.
