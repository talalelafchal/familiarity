Detect the click event of the &quot;Done&quot; button (youtube video)
I have an UIViewController (in my swift application) containing a different elements between them a button. When the button is clicked a create an UIWebView, add it to the subView then a load a youtube video inside it. When the video is fullscreen, I want to dismiss the webView when the "Done" button is clicked. I searched a lot but I didn't find what I'm looking for. Can anyone help me please?
Is your done button on the web page? If so you want to inject javascript code to your done button and cause it to initiate navigation when clicked by using stringByEvaluatingJavaScript(from:). If you set yourself as the delegate of the UIWebview you can intercept the navigation request in the UIWebViewDelegate method webView(_:shouldStartLoadWith:navigationType:). Check if the URL matches what you expect and if so cancel the request and dismiss the webView.
