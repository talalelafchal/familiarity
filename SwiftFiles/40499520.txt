how can I fade in and out different texts on the same UILabel in Swift?
Currently I have an array of strings in my swift and I'm displaying them in a loop on the UILabel: let greetings = ["Test1", "Test2", "Test3", "Test4"] override func viewDidLoad(){ super.viewDidLoad() Timer.scheduledTimer(timeInterval: 2.0, target: self, selector: #selector(TutorialEntryPoint.update), userInfo: nil, repeats: true) } var i = 0 func update() { if(i==4){ i=0 } myLabel.text = greetings[i] i += 1 } That works, but each text disappears and shows suddenly - is there a way of modifying it so that each text disappears/shows smoothly? I thought about using animateWithDuration and modifying alpha, but I'm not sure how to do it properly.
Could try something like this  //inside viewDidLoad let animation = CAKeyframeAnimation() animation.keyPath = "opacity" animation.values = [0, 1, 1, 0] animation.keyTimes = [0, 0.1, 0.9, 1] animation.duration = 2.0 //same as your timer animation.repeatCount = Float.infinity myLabel.layer.addAnimation(animation, forKey: "fade") haven't tested it, so may need some tweaking, but ive used something like this to fade something in and out before
You can animate setting text on label like this UIView.transition(with: label, duration: 0.25, options: [.transitionCrossDissolve], animations: { label.text = "Your Text" }, completion: nil)
