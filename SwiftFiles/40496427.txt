Read from firebase database with Swift
I'm struggling to get the value I need from Firebase I have this setup MyAppName: - version : 1.0 and I am trying to get it like so: let refHandle = dbRootRef.observe(FIRDataEventType.value, with: { (snapshot) in let postDict = snapshot.value as? [String : AnyObject] ?? [:] print(postDict) }) Can someone help me get the 1.0 from the database? p.s - no errors and nothing in the console
