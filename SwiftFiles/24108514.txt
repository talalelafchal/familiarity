How to get CMutablePointer&lt;SCNVector3&gt; from SCNVector3[]?
<p>I'm trying to use SCNGeometrySource's <code>init(vertices: CMutablePointer&lt;SCNVector3&gt;, count: Int)</code> initializer, but I don't know how to make <code>CMutablePointer&lt;SCNVector3&gt;</code>.</p> <p>In Objective-C, I would have used a C array, but I don't think a <code>SCNVector3[]</code> in Swift is laid out that way.</p>
<p>You can get a <code>CMutablePointer&lt;SCNVector3&gt;</code> from <code>SCNVector3[]</code> with <code>&amp;</code>:</p> <pre><code>var vertices: SCNVector3[] = [ ... ] let geometrySource = SCNGeometrySource(vertices: &amp;vertices, count: vertices.count) </code></pre> <p>It's important that vertices is mutable (declared with 'var' instead of 'let').</p> <p>(found thanks to Adam's nudging in the comments above... whose answer I'll accept if he writes one :)</p>
