Using CocoaPods and @IBDesignable together
<p>I have a project using @IBDesignable to control view properties from the Storyboard and everything is working correctly. However, if I integrate pods and add the bridging file as described here (<a href="https://medium.com/swift-programming/swift-cocoapods-da09d8ba6dd2">https://medium.com/swift-programming/swift-cocoapods-da09d8ba6dd2</a>) the Storyboard no longer displays correctly. It displays a blank view in the place where I had my custom view with @IBDesignable. The pods work correctly, just I can't see my changes in the Storyboard. Reverting my changes and removing the pods, solves the issue?</p> <p>Is there anyway to use CocoaPods and @IBDesignable together, or is this just a bug in Xcode6?</p>
<p>Try opening using xcodeproj instead of xcodeworkspace. That worked for me.</p>
<p>If you don't want to support iOS versions below 8.0, you can have use_frameworks! in your pod file (as mentioned here <a href="http://guides.cocoapods.org/syntax/podfile.html#use_frameworks_bang" rel="nofollow">http://guides.cocoapods.org/syntax/podfile.html#use_frameworks_bang</a>). What happen here is instead of making static libraries for your dependencies cocopods will make frameworks. IBDesignable will not break with frameworks.</p>
<p>Have you tried to set the proper module name to your custom view in the storyboard?</p> <pre><code>org.cocoapods.XXX </code></pre> <p><a href="https://i.stack.imgur.com/MmXpX.png" rel="nofollow"><img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/MmXpX.png" alt="enter image description here"></a></p> <p>if you have only XXX works but adding org.cocoapods. fixes a lot of issues.</p>
