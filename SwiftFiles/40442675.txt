Alamofire not working well with swift 3
I have a project written by swift 2. I updated to swift 3, I'm using Alamofire and swiftyjson so I updated their by cocoapods and I fixed all my project issues, after all that I got this error about Alamofire The following binaries use incompatible versions of Swift: also I have these warnings this is my pod file this what I see in terminal after pod update Update all pods Updating local specs repositories CocoaPods 1.2.0.beta.1 is available. To update use: `sudo gem install cocoapods --pre` [!] This is a test version we'd love you to try. For more information, see https://blog.cocoapods.org and the CHANGELOG for this version at https://github.com/CocoaPods/CocoaPods/releases/tag/1.2.0.beta.1 Analyzing dependencies Downloading dependencies Using Alamofire (4.0.1) Using DropDown (2) Using SideMenu (2.0.5) Using SwiftyJSON (3.1.1) Generating Pods project Integrating client project Sending stats Pod installation complete! There are 4 dependencies from the Podfile and 4 total pods installed. [!] The `ehtamiApp [Debug]` target overrides the `EMBEDDED_CONTENT_CONTAINS_SWIFT` build setting defined in `Pods/Target Support Files/Pods-ehtamiApp/Pods-ehtamiApp.debug.xcconfig'. This can lead to problems with the CocoaPods installation - Use the `$(inherited)` flag, or - Remove the build settings from the target. [!] The `ehtamiApp [Release]` target overrides the `EMBEDDED_CONTENT_CONTAINS_SWIFT` build setting defined in `Pods/Target Support Files/Pods-ehtamiApp/Pods-ehtamiApp.release.xcconfig'. This can lead to problems with the CocoaPods installation - Use the `$(inherited)` flag, or - Remove the build settings from the target. what is that mean? and how I can fix it?
