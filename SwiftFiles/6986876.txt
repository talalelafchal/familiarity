How to dim a parent UIView (50% transparent) for login?
<p>I have a view with a Login button. When the button is clicked, I add a view with fields for login. When this happens, I need to dim the parent view. How I do that?</p>
<p>Add a UIView over the parent view that is initially transparent with a background color of black. When you need to dim it, change the view's alpha to 0.5. This will be 50% transparent.</p>
<p>I would go for a view with white background:<p></p> <pre><code> whiteView=[[UIView alloc]initWithFrame:viewToDim.frame]; [whiteView setBackgroundColor:[UIColor whiteColor]]; [whiteView setAlpha:0.5f]; [self.view insertSubview:whiteView aboveSubview:viewToDim]; </code></pre>
<p><code>UIViews</code> have a property named <code>maskView</code>.</p> <p><code>maskView</code> will always be on top of the <strong>UIView</strong> who owns it.</p> <p>so, your approach should be something like this (This is for Swift, but it's easy converted to Obj-c) :</p> <pre><code>self.view.maskView = UIView(frame: self.view.frame) self.view.maskView?.backgroundColor = UIColor.blackColor().colorWithAlphaComponent(0.5) //Do your work here, block UI, anything you need to, and then... self.view.maskView = nil </code></pre>
