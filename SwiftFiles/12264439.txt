Hiding Navigation Bar before and after segue
<p>I have an application where a Table View Controller segues to a View controller and then to another.</p> <p>I want to maximize real estate in the TVC and use</p> <pre><code>[self.navigationController setNavigationBarHidden: YES animated:YES]; </code></pre> <p>to hide the bar. However, the bar returns to the view on the return from segue.</p> <p>The app was constructed in storyboard for 5.1 using Xcode 4.3.1.</p> <p>Can anyone assist by telling me where I can place a similar instruction to remove the Navbar on return from segue OR suggest an alternative method.</p> <p>I have exhausted all means in storyboard by changing attributes for the controllers involved. However what you see in Storyboard isn't always what I get.</p>
<p>I found the answer above in the comment so just documenting it because I used it and it worked well! Thanks to @Tomasz.</p> <p>To prevent the navigation bar reappearing in the header once you go back with the segue, use the following:</p> <pre><code>-(void)viewWillAppear:(BOOL)animated { [self.navigationController setNavigationBarHidden: YES animated:YES]; } </code></pre>
<h2>Swift solution</h2> <pre><code>override func viewWillAppear(animated: Bool) { self.navigationController?.setNavigationBarHidden(true, animated: true) } </code></pre> <p>Thanks @spacemonkey and @Tomasz, this worked.</p>
