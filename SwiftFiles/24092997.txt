Swift and arrays
<p>I am working on writing a Fibonacci number finder in Swift. I am having an issue with using a variable to access an array, like the following:</p> <pre><code>var i = 0; var fibnumbers: Array = [] var lengthOfFibnumbers: Int = fibnumbers.count var e: Int = lengthOfFibnumbers - 1 var addone: Int = fibnumbers[e] </code></pre> <p>When I try this, the playground shows me the red octagon with an exclamation point. When I click on it, it gives the following error: <code>Could not find an overload for 'subscript' that accepts the supplied arguments</code>. </p> <p>How can I fix this?</p>
<p>You should declare fibnumbers as an array of Int:</p> <pre><code>var fibnumbers: [Int] = [] </code></pre> <p>"Array" is defined as a generic (Array). When you don't provide a type for "Array" it is assumed to be "AnyObject". The error you are getting is a little weird but really it is because you are trying to assign the result of the subscript to an <code>Int</code> when you need to convert it from an <code>AnyObject</code> to an <code>Int</code>. For example, this compiles fine: <code>var addone : AnyObject = fibnumbers[e]</code> So it isn't really the subscript that is the problem, despite what the error says.</p>
