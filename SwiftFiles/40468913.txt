Make a phone call from custom widget
I was wondering if it is posible to create a simple widget button in notification bar that makes a phone call when you click on it. I have been reading apple's documentation and one restriction is: Access a sharedApplication object, and so cannot use any of the methods on that object As far as I know, you need to access to UIApplication.sharedInstance to perform a call. Any ideas about that? Thanks in advance!
Use this to text let phoneNumber: String = "1234567890" let phoneNumberString: String = "sms:\(phoneNumber)" let url: NSURL = NSURL(string: phoneNumberString)! if UIApplication.sharedApplication().canOpenURL(url) { UIApplication.sharedApplication().openURL(url) } and this to call let phoneNumber: String = "1234567890" let phoneNumberString: String = "tel:\(phoneNumber)" let url: NSURL = NSURL(string: phoneNumberString)! if UIApplication.sharedApplication().canOpenURL(url) { UIApplication.sharedApplication().openURL(url) }
Ok I respond to myself. After researching information and creating a project from scratch I found that to make a phone call you should use this code:  let phoneNumber: String = "1234567890" let phoneNumberString: String = "tel:\(phoneNumber)" let url: NSURL = NSURL(string: phoneNumberString)! self.extensionContext!.openURL(url, completionHandler: { (Bool) in })
