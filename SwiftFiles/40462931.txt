Convert any Type to bytes in Swift 3
As the title suggests, I'm wondering if anyone out there has any good experience in byte conversion and if there is any good tutorial or information about this. http://codereview.stackexchange.com/questions/114730/type-to-byte-array-conversion-in-swift This post explains it very well but if I understand it correctly you can only use this on types like Int, float, Double and so on. I want to learn how to convert any type, like a custom made class to bytes.
