Fetch all users from Firebase with Facebook login - swift
My app is using Facebook login only at the moment. I am trying to build a search function using the UISearchBar. So my question is: Is it in any way possible to fetch all users from the Firebase database into an array? Maybe even get their UserID as well?? If you want to see any piece of code let me know, I just did not think it was relevant to this question :-)
If I have understood what you're trying to achieve then you should simply be able to save your users to the Realtime database upon registering/authenitcating your users. After this you can perform a simple observeSingleEventOf to get all your users at the correct path, something like this: rootRef.usersRef.observeSingleEvent(ofType: .value)..... Then with the completion handler you should get back a snapshot, the snapshot.value will include all your users. *Please note that you don't need to stop observing this method since it will observe the values once then immediately stop. So I don't think you need to worry about memory issues.
