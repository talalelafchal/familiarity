Variable And Function Calls On Lines By Themselves In Swift
<p>I'm reading the iBook <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/book/swift-programming-language/id881256329?mt=11" rel="nofollow">The Swift Programming Language</a> and seeing a convention that I don't understand and hasn't been explained in the book: variable and functions followed by a single line with the variable or function name by itself.</p> <p>For example:</p> <pre><code>var n = 2 while n &lt; 100 { n = n * 2 } n var m = 2 do { m = m * 2 } while m &lt; 100 m </code></pre> <p>And:</p> <pre><code>func returnFifteen() -&gt; Int { var y = 10 func add() { y += 5 } add() return y } returnFifteen() </code></pre> <p>What is the purpose of these lines where the variable or function name are on a line by themselves?</p> <p>TIA</p>
<p>The purpose is for "Playground" Demonstrations. For example, if you put that code into playground. The window on the right will show result of the execution of the function.</p> <p>If you were in a traditional project, you would likely do:</p> <pre><code>func returnFifteen() -&gt; Int { var y = 10 func add() { y += 5 } add() return y } var someInt = returnFifteen() println(someInt) </code></pre> <p>However, this is unnecessary in Playground:</p> <p><img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/fWpfH.png" alt="enter image description here"></p> <p>Notice the right side.</p>
<p>When you are using Swift in the playground, the output display on the right hand side is not actually a console output more so just an output of whatever variable is on that line, or the number of times a loop runs.</p> <p>So they are placing the variable/function on it's own line so that when you paste that into Playground you will see what the result is.</p>
