dyld: Library not loaded: @rpath/libswift_stdlib_core.dylib when running on iPhone
<p><strong>Update 2:</strong> This is an old question involving the developer beta of iOS 8 and Xcode. The problem was that the Swift standard library wasn't included in the iPhone 4s iOS 8 beta. The issue has been resolved in the release. </p> <p><strong>Update:</strong> I've been getting fed up with the errors and crashes that come along with beta software, so I decided to reset my phone to iOS 7.1.1 and now the error is <em>gone</em>... I have no idea what is going on, but I'm going to assume its a bug since iOS 8 is still in beta. I will file a bug report with Apple and hope it gets resolved with the next seed.</p> <hr> <p>As many other people before me, I am receiving the following error message when running a swift-based app on my iPhone (4S running iOS 8.0 beta 1):</p> <pre><code>dyld: Library not loaded: @rpath/libswift_stdlib_core.dylib Referenced from: /private/var/mobile/Containers/Bundle/Application/ CDC7263B-9F18-4369-87CC-F36DB5163B99/TESTPROJECT.app/TESTPROJECT Reason: no suitable image found.

(Also happens with an empty application) - I have already tried the solution found <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/24002836/dyld-library-not-loaded-rpath-libswift-stdlib-core-dylib">here</a> (restarting Xcode)</p> <p>I can't seem to find any other way of moving/accessing the required swift library.</p>
<p>I hit this problem in simulator. I tried some settings listed here <a href="http://ikevin.tw/?p=174" rel="nofollow">http://ikevin.tw/?p=174</a>.</p> <p>In summary, Defines Module -> Yes, Embedded Content Contains Swift Code -> Yes, Product Module Name -> [My product name].</p> <p>These changes managed to get me to launch and run.</p> <p>The trick is that afterwards, I reverted the changes to see which of them actually made a difference. After reverting all of them, the app still launched. So it's completely unclear what actually caused the app to end up launching.</p>
<p>For me, quitting and relaunching Xcode made this go away.</p>
<p>I'm guessing your iPhone 4S is lower than iOS 6. We also did regression tests on iPhone 4S's on iOS 6 and 7 but they were all fine. Devices on iOS 5 and 5.1 had the same error as you have though.</p>
<p>I had this issue using an Ad Hoc (or enterprise) mobileprovision with a production certificate. Switching to a development certificate and mobileprovision solved the issue.</p>
<p>I ran into the same problem and I think it maybe because the app has to be configured to dynamically load certain frameworks. In any case changing the "Runpath Search Paths" build setting to "@executable_path/Frameworks" seemed to fix the problem. </p> <p>I'm guessing that Xcode sets this automatically for new projects but older projects may need to be fixed manually. In my older project it was blank.</p>
<p>99% of the time when you get an error like this when upgrading the beta, it's the cache in ~/Library/Caches/com.apple.dt.Xcode* directories. Delete these and rebuild.</p>
<p>I had the same issue on an exploratory project. When I tried to build on a device I got the error. All I had to do was set the 'Provisioning Profile' in 'Code Signing' and everything worked. <img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/0BPQh.png" alt="enter image description here"></p>
