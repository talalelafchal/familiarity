Map function over T?
<p>I just started learning Swift and have a question. I found the following block of code in the "The Swift programming language" book:</p> <pre><code>var optionalName: String? = "John Appleseed" var greeting = "Hello!" if let name = optionalName { greeting = "Hello, \(name)" } </code></pre> <p>And then I thought, why should I do <code>if let name = optionalName { greeting = "Hello, \(name)" }</code> every time I need to map a function over boxed value? I found <code>T?</code> looking very similar to <code>Maybe a</code> from Haskell. </p> <p>So is there any library function for <code>fmap f boxedValue</code>? Or am I thinking too functional for Swift? </p>
<p>Your thinking is just fine! Optional defines a map() method, so you can do:</p> <pre><code>boxedValue.map(f) </code></pre>
