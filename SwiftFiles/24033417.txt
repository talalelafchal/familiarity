Unable to run app in Simulator : Xcode beta 6 iOS 8
<p>I am unable to launch my app on simulator using xcode 6 beta and iPhone 5s simulator. First I am getting an error message from Simulator "Unable to boot the iOS simulator", and then after xcode is showing me following error,</p> <p><img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/CNw2d.png" alt="Xcode Error"></p>
<ul> <li>Make sure you choose XCode6 as Command Line Tools in Preferences > Locations Section</li> </ul> <p><img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/Zow3E.png" alt="XCode6 Preferences"></p> <ul> <li><p>Make sure you open XCode 6 from Applications not from the setup file.</p></li> <li><p>Finally restarting Mac solve the problem in my case.</p></li> </ul>
<p>This happens most of the times because another instance of the simulator is running in the dock.</p> <p>Kill the other instance &amp; things should work fine.</p>
<p>I solved it following these steps:</p> <ol> <li>Open Xcode 6 beta</li> <li>Go to the menu Xcode > Open Developer Tool > iOS Simulator</li> <li>Even if an error dialog shows up, you still would have access to the iOS Simulator's menu</li> <li>Select Hardware > Device > Manage Devices</li> <li>Click on the little + sign at the bottom</li> <li>Add (if missing) all the devices that you want, or delete and recreate the ones malfunctioning.</li> <li>If anyone of the simulator is not working then right click on it and delete it and then re-create it again</li> </ol> <p><img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/nGgm6.png" alt="enter image description here"></p>
<p>After I found some solutions on the web, a combination of procedures worked for me:</p> <ol> <li><p>Close Xcode and iOS Simulator (and all related applications)</p></li> <li><p>Install (or reinstall) Xcode6-Beta to Applications folder (direct from the .dmg file)</p></li> <li><p>Open Xcode6-Beta and go to Xcode -> Preferences -> Locations -> Command Line Tools and select "Xcode 6.0" (be sure that you've selected the one in Applications folder)</p></li> <li><p>Launch the iOS Simulator and go to iOS Simulator -> Reset Content and Settings...</p></li> <li><p>Close all the applications and restart your mac (I unchecked "Reopen windows...")</p></li> <li><p>Open Xcode6-beta and test the iOS Simulator</p></li> </ol> <p>Good luck</p>
<p>I got this problem after renaming the default folder name "Xcode-Beta2" to "Xcode". When I renamed it back to "Xcode-Beta2", the simulator worked as before.</p>
<p>I had this problem until I put the Xcode 6-beta application file from inside a folder I had in my application directory to the Application directory itself. Restarted computer. Then it worked.</p> <p>To test, I created a folder in my Application directory again and put my Xcode application in there and, again, it did not work. Put it back into Application directory itself; it worked. I didn't even have to restart in these cases.</p> <p>I would <em>really</em> hope Apple is beyond hardcoding paths.</p>
<p>I'm using XCode 6 beta2 and has problem (error code = 4 in my case) running iPad simulators. I think I had the issue because I'm running dual Mac OS boot and the XCode is launched from another startup disk</p> <p>I did both steps recommended by @ayalcinkaya and @apascual, and this worked for me.</p> <ul> <li>Change the "Command Line Tool" to XCode BETA2 (from 5.1.1 in my case) in "XCode->Preference->Locations"</li> <li>Open Xcode 6 beta2</li> <li>Go to the menu Xcode > Open Developer Tool > iOS Simulator</li> <li>Even if an error dialog shows up, you still would have access to the iOS Simulator's menu Select Hardware > Devices, and switch between iPad devices and this apparently made the simulators reconfigured</li> <li>While the simulator is running, run the app with the selected simulator.</li> <li>After going through this manual process once, everything is fine.</li> </ul>
<p>What worked for me was removing all of the devices in "Manage Devices" and adding them back <strong>after</strong> rebooting</p>
<p>For me, I simply hadn't updated XCode from the Developer Center which was now Xcode 6 beta 6. I'd gotten spoilt with the automated App Store updates, and forgot about ye old manual download process. </p>
<p>i was facing the same problem, what i done is I downloaded simulator for IOS7 what you need to do is go to:- 1.Xcode->preferences->Downloads->Components 2.after that in your project under general settings-select Deployment target as 7.0 3.the last thing is select any simulator under 7.0 :)</p>
<p>I received this error trying to run one of my iPad only apps on the iPhone Simulator. It's built as a universal app, I've run it multiple times on the iPhone for testing, and I only recently checked the "iPad" only checkbox in the Target config.</p> <p>When trying to run it on my iPhone Device, I got the much more helpful error message: "The application at [/location/..../Name.app] can only be installed on iPads."</p>
<p>The most common cause for the error reporting is that DYLD_INSERT_LIBRARIES is set. Most people reporting this issue have had it set in /etc/launchd.conf. You can edit that file to remove it (or just delete the file as that's likely the only line) and reboot to address the issue.</p> <p>Another possible cause for this problem is that you may have renamed Xcode.app after running it the first time. If that's the case, just reboot (or rename it back to what it was before).</p>
<p>I also had this problem and found the solution by doing following steps:-</p> <pre><code> 1) Initially i downloaded Xcode 6 library in Documentation section under the path Xcode --&gt; Preferences --&gt; Downloads and restart my xcode but didn't solve my problem. After that -&gt; 2) Downloaded and installed the iOS 7.1 Simulator under the path Xcode --&gt; Preferences --&gt; Downloads. Restart xcode again and the problem solved. 3) I am facing same issue again next morning. Unsetting the DYLD_INSERT_LIBRARIES variable solves my problem:- a) Open terminal and type "sudo vi /etc/launchd.conf" command and press Enter b) Press I "Insert" mode and change this "setenv DYLD_INSERT_LIBRARIES /usr/lib/libimckit.dylib" to this "unsetenv DYLD_INSERT_LIBRARIES /usr/lib/libimckit.dylib" and press esc to exit from insert mode. c) Save changes by typing ":wq" Press Enter d) Reboot your system and problem soloved. </code></pre> <p><img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/J59s7.png" alt="enter image description here"></p> <pre><code>Prior to that i didn't found any iOS version in front of each listed devices but after installation or by unsetting DYLD_INSERT_LIBRARIES variable i found the same in front of each devices. </code></pre> <blockquote> <p>> <img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/4dZcF.png" alt="enter image description here"> </p> </blockquote> <p>Hope this helps anyone.</p>
<p>Clean -> Run fixed it for me.</p> <p>I've tried the rest, nothing helped. Although it may be required too. </p>
<p>I've tried everything above.</p> <p>But found that i have to update to newest OS X 10.10.1 (From OS X 10.9.5) to get iOS 8.1 to work</p>
<p>Yes apascual is correct <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/a/24080160/2905967">http://stackoverflow.com/a/24080160/2905967</a></p> <p>But for me, before step 5, I have deleted the simulator device (select and by pressing Delete key from keyboard) Which device is giving the Problem. Reference: <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/a/24080160/2905967">apascual answer</a></p>
<p>I've had the same problem, when running an app with the same name as a previously run different app. </p> <p>Run "foo" -> make a new project named "foo" -> run -> error.</p> <p>Whatsoever - it seems to me that there are several reasons for iOS-Simulator to say "ehm, what do you want from me? OK, I'll throw an error..." ;-) </p> <p>MY SOLUTION: Close iOS simulator, run app again.</p> <p>That's it in most of cases like this.</p>
<p>These steps may help you with your problem. Try this:</p> <p>1( Click iOS Simulator at the top of your screen</p> <p>2( Click Reset Contents and Settings</p> <p>3( Click Reset when the Alert comes up</p> <p>4( Run the App again on the Simulator</p> <p>This will simply reset all the contents and settings on the iOS Simulator previously.</p> <p>Hope this helps with the error.</p>
<p>I had the same problem and only solution that helped me to fix this was to reinstall Xcode.</p>
<p>Delete simulator/s and create again in Xcode/Window/Devices worked for me... </p>
