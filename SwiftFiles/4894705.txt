Can I programmatically scroll to a desired row in UIPickerView?
<p>By default the first row is highlighted after initializing the UIPickerView. How do i highlight a particular row or scroll to particular row programmatically?</p>
<p>Yes, it's very easy <code>[picker selectRow:row inComponent:component animated:NO];</code></p>
<p>As always, this is thoroughly documented. The Apple documentation for <a href="http://developer.apple.com/library/ios/#documentation/uikit/reference/UIPickerView_Class/Reference/UIPickerView.html"><code>UIPickerView</code></a> should tell you that the method you probably want is <code>â€“ selectRow:inComponent:animated:</code>.</p>
<p>If you want to trigger delegate's method pickerView:didSelectRow:inComponent, you should call it manually:</p> <p><strong>Obj-C</strong></p> <pre><code>[self.myPickerView selectRow:0 inComponent:0 animated:NO]; [self pickerView:self.myPickerView didSelectRow:4 inComponent:0]; </code></pre> <p><strong>Swift</strong></p> <pre><code>self.myPickerView.selectRow(0, inComponent: 0, animated: false) self.pickerView(self.myPickerView, didSelectRow: 0, inComponent: 0) </code></pre>
<blockquote> <p>Working in iOS 9 with XCode 7.3, to make runtime changes to data in a picker view called fieldPicker:</p> </blockquote> <pre><code>// first load your new data to your picker view's data source (not shown here...) then load the data into the picker view using it's delegate [self.fieldPicker reloadAllComponents]; // now that the data is loaded, select a row in the picker view through it's delegate [self.fieldPicker selectRow:([self.theFields count] - 1) inComponent:0 animated:NO]; // retrieve the row selected in the picker view to use in setting data from your data source in textboxes etc. long row = (long)[self.fieldPicker selectedRowInComponent: 0]; </code></pre>
