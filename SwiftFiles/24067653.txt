Include path for XCode6 Beta
<p>Swift has portions of Darwin implemented, for instance this works:</p> <pre><code>import Darwin rand() </code></pre> <p>Where does XCode6 store the underlying include files for this? I wanted to add in scanf functionality the same way they added in rand().</p>
<p>If you type "rand()" in a Swift notebook, do Jump to Definition in Xcode (CMD-CTRL-J), it will take you to the Swift header for the C standard library.</p> <p>I believe you can see there all the C standard library functions where Apple has provided a Swift API. But you can't see the Swift implementation, since I don't think that's supplied. I would guess it's compiled into the Swift framework.</p> <p>But what you asked is where that header file is located. Here's how to find it:</p> <ol> <li>Create a Swift command-line application, and use the rand() function.</li> <li>Build it.</li> <li>In the Report Navigator, expand all the underlying command-line build commands, to look for the paths that were passed to the compiler.</li> </ol> <p>If you look at the paths in the link phase, you may find something at <code>/Applications/Xcode6-Beta.app/Contents/Developer/Toolchains/XcodeDefault.xctoolchain/usr/lib/swift/macosx </code>.</p> <p>But I don't think Swift is using a plaintext file format for the headers, and I think the headers only give you access to C's standard lib because there's also a compiled Swift wrapper layer in between, or some kind of bridging header, so it may not be easy to just add missing functions at this point.</p>
