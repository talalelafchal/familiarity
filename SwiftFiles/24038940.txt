Can Someone Explain Why This Doesn't Work?
<p>I know this example is entirely useless and contrived, but I'm trying to better wrap my head around how values get handled in Swift and I don't understand why the following code returns an error.</p> <pre><code>var notSorted = sort([1,2,3,4]){true} </code></pre>
<p>The second parameter of <code>sort</code> has type <code>(T, T) -&gt; Bool</code>, but you are supplying a <code>() -&gt; Bool</code>, namely a closure with no parameters that returns <code>true</code>.</p> <p>Of course the two types don't match and you rightfully get a compile-time error.</p> <p>Something like this will work:</p> <pre><code>var notSorted = sort([1,2,3,4]){_ in true} </code></pre> <hr> <p>By the way, that closure has the effect of reversing the array. If you want to perform a nop, you have to put <code>false</code>.</p>
