Firebase Snapshot: is the children enumerator lazy or eager?
The title pretty much sums it up. I'm wondering if I can iterate part of the way through a very large set of children without incurring the IO and memory cost of loading them all at once. Here's what the code looks like: let enumerator = snapshot.children var stop = false while let childSnapshot = enumerator.nextObject() as? FDataSnapshot where !stop { // do stuff with childSnapshot // possibly set stop to true } Obviously the cost would be similar if I iterated the whole list but I plan to bail out after only a few.
