How do I access a random index inside an array
<p>I'm trying to access an array using random indexes by using <code>arc4random</code> to generate the random index. I'm sorry if my "technical usage of terms" are incorrect as I am fairly new to the development scene. </p> <pre><code>var backLeft = ["Clear","Drop","Smash"]; var i = (arc4random()%(3)) var shot = backLeft[i] </code></pre> <p>This gives me an error on the third line, </p> <pre><code>Could not find an overload for 'subscript' that accepts the supplied arguments. </code></pre> <p>But, if I use,</p> <pre><code>var i = 2 var shot = backLeft[i] </code></pre> <p>Then it doesn't give me any issues. Coming from a php background, I can't seem to have any clue what's going wrong here. </p> <p>Thank You! :) PS: I'm trying this on XCODE 6 inside the Swift Playground</p>
<p>That's due to Swift's enforcement of type safety. </p> <p><code>arc4random()</code> returns a <code>UInt32</code>, and the subscript operator takes an <code>Int</code>.</p> <p>You need to make sure <code>i</code> is of type <code>Int</code> before passing it into the subscript operator. </p> <p>You can do so by initializing an <code>Int</code> from <code>i</code>:</p> <pre><code>var shot = backLeft[Int(i)] </code></pre> <p>Or, you can do the same to the random value before assigning it to <code>i</code> and then access <code>i</code> normally:</p> <pre><code>var i = Int(arc4random()%(3)) var shot = backLeft[i] </code></pre>
