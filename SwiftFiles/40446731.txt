Xcode 8.1 Not Autocompleting type alias callbacks
It's really weird for Xcode (Version 8.1 (8B62)) to act like this, not helping me to auto complete the callbacks, let me give you a specific example: See the photo, when I double click or enter in that suggested call back, which is the SingleRequestCallBack, Xcode should give me a block. But it's not. Instead Xcode just completing that statement which is FirebaseSingleRequest.SingleRequestCallBack, and if you double click on the suggested call back, Xcode would give you a bug report in your editor and making all the codes white. That happens too in the Firebase library and even in the UIViewController functions (such as dismiss). See the second screenshot. Steps I already made: Clean and Clean the Build of the project. Restart Xcode Shut down the machine. So the question is: How to fix this? What causes this issue?
