UIImagePickerController tutorial?
<p>I am currently developing an application and I need to be able when pressing a button to open the camera and take a snapshot that I will attach to a .json file and send to my server. I am searching on google and StackOverflow for the last couple of hours but all the tutorials seem very old (08'-09') or not match my needs. I know that all the work is done with <code>UIImagePickerController</code> class but I would like to have a working example. Does anyone know a good tutorial to get started for something like this?</p>
<p>Try <a href="http://www.zimbio.com/iPhone/articles/1109/Picking+Images+iPhone+SDK+UIImagePickerController" rel="nofollow">this</a>. It's very simple, you just need to set delegate for a controller and call it. Google will help you, there are plenty of resources and working examples. For instance, <a href="http://developer.apple.com/library/ios/#samplecode/PhotoLocations/Introduction/Intro.html#//apple_ref/doc/uid/DTS40008909" rel="nofollow">sample code from Apple</a></p>
<p>Well if you google something like:</p> <blockquote> <p>UIImagePickerController and take snapshot put in json and send to server</p> </blockquote> <p>Will be a bit hard. So, use <a href="http://blog.hanpo.tw/2012/01/uiimagepickercontroller-and-simple.html" rel="nofollow">this</a> tutorial for the <code>UIImagePickerController</code>. By the way, the term for the search was:</p> <blockquote> <p>UIImagePickerController Tutorial 2012</p> </blockquote>
<p>You should check this article from AppCoda <a href="http://www.appcoda.com/ios-programming-camera-iphone-app/">Build a Simple iPhone Camera App</a>, very clear and simple :)</p> <p>Take photo using the native iOS Camera app</p> <pre><code>- (IBAction)takePhoto:(UIButton *)sender { UIImagePickerController *picker = [[UIImagePickerController alloc] init]; picker.delegate = self; picker.allowsEditing = YES; picker.sourceType = UIImagePickerControllerSourceTypeCamera; [self presentViewController:picker animated:YES completion:nil]; } </code></pre> <p>Read the captured photo (you have to implement <code>UIImagePickerControllerDelegate</code></p> <pre><code>- (void)imagePickerController:(UIImagePickerController *)picker didFinishPickingMediaWithInfo:(NSDictionary *)info { UIImage *chosenImage = info[UIImagePickerControllerEditedImage]; self.imageView.image = chosenImage; [picker dismissViewControllerAnimated:YES completion:nil]; } </code></pre>
<p>I came across this code <a href="https://github.com/aqavi-paracha/AQPhotoPicker" rel="nofollow">AQPhotoPicker</a>. This is quite easy to use with only one call, you will get photo from camera or photoPicker</p>
