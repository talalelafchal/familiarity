Can I compile Swift with Xcode &lt; 6?
<p>I would like to try out Swift, but currently don't have an Apple developer 's account. Would it be possible to compile and run it without having Xcode 6?</p>
<p>According to <a href="https://developer.apple.com/swift/">https://developer.apple.com/swift/</a>, the only current implementation is the XCode 6 Beta. The language documentation (<a href="https://itunes.apple.com/gb/book/swift-programming-language/id881256329?mt=11">ebook</a> and <a href="https://developer.apple.com/library/prerelease/ios/documentation/Swift/Conceptual/Swift_Programming_Language/TheBasics.html#//apple_ref/doc/uid/TP40014097-CH5">online</a>) doesn't mention any alternatives.</p> <p><del>As far as I can tell, you have to be a <em>paid</em> member of an Apple Developer program to get the <a href="https://developer.apple.com/xcode/downloads/">XCode 6 Beta</a>:</del></p> <p><del>"Sign in with the Apple ID associated with your membership in the iOS Developer Program or Mac Developer Program ..."</del></p> <p><strong>Update:</strong> In a departure from past policy, Apple has made the XCode 6 beta available as a free download. See the new <a href="https://developer.apple.com/swift/blog/">Swift blog</a> for details, or <a href="https://developer.apple.com/devcenter/download.action?path=/Developer_Tools/xcode_6_beta_3_lpw27r/xcode_6_beta_3.dmg">download directly</a>!</p>
<p>Wait for release of Xcode 6, which will be available in the Mac App Store. (I am not an authority to say this, but since Xcode 5 is available for free in Mac App Store, Xcode 6 should replace it once it's released)</p> <p>Developing in Xcode 5 does not require paid developer account. </p> <p>From <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Xcode#Version_history" rel="nofollow">Wikipedia</a>:</p> <blockquote> <p>Xcode 4.1 was made available for free on July 20, 2011 (the day of Mac OS X Lion's release) to all users of Mac OS X Lion on the Mac App Store</p> </blockquote> <p>Annual fee of $99 or Â£79 will give access to beta releases and provides access to App Store to release your apps.</p>
