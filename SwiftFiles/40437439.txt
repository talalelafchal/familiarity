Disable scrolling in tableview while popup is opened
I created simple poUp in swift however I can't seem to find answer to "how to disable scrolling in tableview while popup is opened?". The problem is that if popUp is opened I do not want to scroll. That is how I create the popUp inside tableview if button is tapped: let popOverVC = UIStoryboard(name: "Main", bundle: nil).instantiateViewController(withIdentifier: "RatingViewController") as! RatingViewController self.addChildViewController(popOverVC) popOverVC.view.frame = self.view.frame self.view.addSubview(popOverVC.view) popOverVC.didMove(toParentViewController: self) tableView.alwaysBounceVertical = false I want it to be full screen and scrolling disabled but right now it is under navigationBar and scrolling is enabled. I tried adding this line tableView.alwaysBounceVertical = false but it does nothing. To illustrate things:
UITableViewinherits from UIScrollView. You can controll scrolling by setting isScrollEnabled.
There are two ways. You can disable scrolling this way : tableview.isScrollEnabled = false Or you can put a transparent view behind PopUp View, making it the size of the screen. This way, users won't be able to touch table view anyway :)
