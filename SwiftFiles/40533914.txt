Is there any alternative for NSInvocation in Swift?
I'm trying to invoke a selector, with multiple (2+) arguments (the number of arguments can be determined). However, the selector is unknown at compile time (generated with NSSelectorFromString, actually). In Objective-C, I could create an invocation and set arguments to it and invoke it. But this is not available in Swift. Is there any way around this? Like: let obj = SomeClass() let selector = NSSelectorFromString("arg1:arg2:arg3:") //selector, arguments known only at runtime //invoke selector
I'm afraid there is no way to do this in Swift. However, you may have an Objective-C class to manage your dynamic invocations. You can use NSInvocation there.
