How to delete a row in NSTableView (Swift)
I have been able to add strings/data to a table from secondViewController to firstViewController but now I want users to be able to delete rows as well. How will I be able to delete the row? Update: So here is some more detail: This is the code that I am using to create table in 1stVC. func numberOfRows(in tableView: NSTableView) -> Int { return arrayData.count } func tableView(_ tableView: NSTableView, objectValueFor tableColumn: NSTableColumn?, row: Int) -> Any? { return arrayData[row] } I have set an array as well that is getting the data from 2ndVC through a delegate. The values from 2ndVC are stored in a variable called "data" in the 1stVC and then added to an array like so: arrayData.append(data!) Now I want to put a delete button, that can remove the rows/inserted data. Thanks!
The usual way is to remove the object from the data source array and then call removeRowsAtIndexPaths:withAnimation: on the table view if let index = arrayData.index(of: object) { arrayData.remove(at: index) let indexSet = IndexSet(integer:index) tableView.removeRows(at:indexSet, withAnimation:.effectFade) }
