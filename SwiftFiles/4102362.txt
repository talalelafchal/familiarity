Remove all the subviews from a UIScrollView?
<p>How do I remove all of the subviews from a UIScrollview?</p>
<p>Let <code>scrollView</code> be an instance of <code>UIScrollView</code>.</p> <p>In Objective-C, it's pretty easy. Just call <code>makeObjectsPerformSelector:</code>, like so:</p> <p><strong>Objective-C:</strong></p> <pre><code>[scrollView.subviews makeObjectsPerformSelector:@selector(removeFromSuperview)]; </code></pre> <p>In Swift, you don't get that runtime access, so you have to actually handle the iteration yourself. </p> <p><strong>Swift:</strong></p> <p>A concise version, <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/a/24446427/224988">from here</a>:</p> <pre><code>scrollview.subviews.map { $0.removeFromSuperview() } </code></pre> <p>A more descriptive way to do this (from <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/a/27065076/224988">here</a>) assumes <code>scrollview.subviews</code>:</p> <pre><code>let subviews = self.scrollView.subviews for subview in subviews{ subview.removeFromSuperview() } </code></pre>
<p>I think you just have to be careful and not to delete the scroll indicator bars.</p> <p>The code given by Adam Ko is short and elegant but it may delete the horizontal and vertical scroll indicators.</p> <p>I usually do</p> <pre><code>for (UIView *v in scrollView.subviews) { if (![v isKindOfClass:[UIImageView class]]) { [v removeFromSuperview]; } } </code></pre> <p>Suposing you don't have UIImageView's added to the scroll manually.</p>
<p>If you want to remove uiimageviews in scrollview.subviews, and you also want to keep the vertical and horizontal indicators. You can set a special "tag" to identify views and exclude vertical and horizontal indicators whose tags are 0 by default.</p>
<p>In addition to Ricardo de Cillo's, in my case I had a table view that had imageviews in the subviews that I wanted to remove.</p> <pre><code>for (UIView *v in self.tableview.subviews) { if ([v isKindOfClass:[UIImageView class]]) { [v removeFromSuperview]; } } </code></pre> <p>The removal of the ! in the if command, and change <code>scrollview</code> to <code>self.tableview</code> removed all images, but left the table view untouched.</p>
<p>Complementing the Swift concise version from a previous answer (Swift 3.0 ready):</p> <pre><code>_ = scrollView.subviews.filter { $0 is UIImageView }.map { $0.removeFromSuperview() } </code></pre>
