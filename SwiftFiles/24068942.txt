Swift runtime documentation
<p>I have been exploring Apple's swift documentation, and now i'm here to ask.</p> <p><strong>Is documentation about Swift's runtime available?</strong></p> <p>I have read The Swift Programming Language book. <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/book/swift-programming-language/id881256329?mt=11">https://itunes.apple.com/us/book/swift-programming-language/id881256329?mt=11</a></p> <p>I have watched WWDC videos. <a href="https://developer.apple.com/videos/wwdc/2014/">https://developer.apple.com/videos/wwdc/2014/</a></p> <p>I have tried searching Swifts compiler source code, or runtime library source code.</p> <p>But I've found out nothing, except few questions that actually about Obj-c <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/24019683/swift-function-swizzling-runtime">Swift function swizzling / runtime</a> </p> <p>I mean, everybody know how obj-c works. isa pointer, cmd, how do we call methods, dynamic binding and other. We know how parameters passed by registers. We can use MachOView to define all methods and classes used in binary. There are many documents about obj-c runtime, open source runtime library. Clang is open source. But what about swift? </p> <p>This information exists in a centralized location for Objective-C. I'm asking for the equivalent of the Obj-C runtime library documentation.</p>
<p>This documentation hasn't been released, and nobody outside of Apple knows if it ever will.</p> <p>Since the ObjC runtime is <a href="http://www.opensource.apple.com/source/objc4/objc4-551.1/" rel="nofollow">available</a> on opensource.apple.com, I would imagine that the Swift runtime library source will be made available once Yosemite becomes public.</p>
