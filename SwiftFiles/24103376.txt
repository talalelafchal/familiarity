Is there a way to get line number and function name in Swift language?
<p>In Objective-C, we could use the <code>__LINE__</code> and <code>__PRETTY_FUNCTION__</code> macros. These are not exposed in the Swift language. Is there another way to get similar information in Swift?</p>

<pre class="lang-none prettyprint-override"><code>Literal Type Value #file String The name of the file in which it appears. #line Int The line number on which it appears. #column Int The column number in which it begins. #function String The name of the declaration in which it appears. #dsohandle String The dso handle. </code></pre> <p>Example</p> <pre><code>print("Function: \(#function), line: \(#line)") </code></pre> <p>With default values in parameters you can also create a function </p> <pre><code>public func track(_ message: String, file: String = #file, function: String = #function, line: Int = #line ) { print("\(message) called from \(#function) \(#file):\(#line)") } </code></pre> <p>which can be used like this</p> <pre><code>track("enters app") </code></pre> <p>See documentation for more information <a href="https://developer.apple.com/library/content/documentation/Swift/Conceptual/Swift_Programming_Language/Expressions.html#//apple_ref/doc/uid/TP40014097-CH32-ID390" rel="nofollow noreferrer">https://developer.apple.com/library/content/documentation/Swift/Conceptual/Swift_Programming_Language/Expressions.html#//apple_ref/doc/uid/TP40014097-CH32-ID390</a></p> <hr> <p><strong>In Swift 2.1 and below:</strong></p> <pre class="lang-none prettyprint-override"><code>Literal Type Value __FILE__ String The name of the file in which it appears. __LINE__ Int The line number on which it appears. __COLUMN__ Int The column number in which it begins. __FUNCTION__ String The name of the declaration in which it appears. </code></pre> <p>Example</p> <pre><code>print("Function: \(__FUNCTION__), line: \(__LINE__)") </code></pre>
