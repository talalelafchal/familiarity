&quot;ERROR ITMS-90535&quot; when archiving app to iTunes connects
I got this error while archiving my app to iTunes connect. "ERROR ITMS-90535: "Unexpected CFBundleExecutable Key. The bundle at 'Payload/go.app/Stripe.bundle' does not contain a bundle executable. If this bundle intentionally does not contain an executable, consider removing the CFBundleExecutable key from its Info.plist and using a CFBundlePackageType of BNDL. If this bundle is part of a third-party framework, consider contacting the developer of the framework for an update to address this issue." How can I fix it? I already tried deleting the info pilist CFBundleExecutable key. It didn't work
