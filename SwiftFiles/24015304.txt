Highlight titlebar only when mouse is over?
<p>I want to implement a titlebar experience just like the iBooks app on OS X. Basically, the titlebar is always <em>not highlight</em> even if the window is key window right now. However, it did has the cute <em>fade in</em> like animation that paints the titlebar. </p> <p>I'm wondering how to implement this kind of window titlebar?</p> <p>My first guess if leveraging <a href="https://github.com/indragiek/INAppStoreWindow" rel="nofollow">INAppStoreWindow</a>, and handle the mouse entered and mouse exited event? But I don't find out how to dim the titlebar, and how to fade in.</p> <p>So any suggestions for this?</p>
