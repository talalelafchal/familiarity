You can simply do this with this API call: https://maps.googleapis.com/maps/api/distancematrix/json?origins=51.226531,4.190688&destinations=51.114476,4.139618|51.148123,4.182590 There are three parameters in this URL , json is used to return the response origins contains the long and lat of the current location of the user and destination contains all the addresses form which you want to find the nearest distance. the addresses will be in long and lat format and is seperated by "|". The response will be as follow  { "destination_addresses" : [ "Dorpstraat 70, 9140 Temse, België", "Eigenlostraat 38, 9100 Sint-Niklaas, België" ], "origin_addresses" : [ "Provinciale Baan 37, 9120 Beveren, België" ], "rows" : [ { "elements" : [ { "distance" : { "text" : "16,3 km", "value" : 16346 }, "duration" : { "text" : "22 min.", "value" : 1321 }, "status" : "OK" }, { "distance" : { "text" : "10,5 km", "value" : 10521 }, "duration" : { "text" : "17 min.", "value" : 1003 }, "status" : "OK" } ] } ], "status" : "OK" } All you have to do is to get the nearest destination on the time basis .
