React native: Real time camera data without image save and preview
I started working on my first non-demo react-native app. I hope it will be a iOS/Android app, but actually I'm focused on iOS only. I have a one problem actually. How can I get a data (base64, array of pixels, ...) in real-time from the camera without saving to the camera roll. There is this module: https://github.com/lwansbrough/react-native-camera but base64 is deprecated and is useless for me, because I want a render processed image to user (change picture colors eg.), not the real picture from camera, as it does react-native-camera module. (I know how to communicate with SWIFT code, but I don't know what the options are in native code, I come here from WebDev) Thanks a lot.
