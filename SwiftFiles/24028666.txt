Is this response from the compiler valid?
<p>The following code invokes an error. I could not find any information on this is in the reference. The lack of whitespace on the right hand side of the '=' operator is an error.</p> <pre><code>let names =["Anna", "Alex", "Brian", "Jack"] </code></pre> <p>Any other combination of this syntax compiles. Anyone know if this is truly invalid syntax per what we know of Swift right now?</p> <p>EDIT: Error response is: <code>Prefix/postfix '=' is reserved</code></p> <p>ANSWER: This excerpt seems to answer my question. I just couldn't find it for the longest time:</p> <blockquote> <p>The whitespace around an operator is used to determine whether an operator is used as a prefix operator, a postfix operator, or a binary operator. This behavior is summarized in the following rules:</p> <p>If an operator has whitespace around both sides or around neither side, it is treated as a binary operator. As an example, the + operator in a+b and a + b is treated as a binary operator. If an operator has whitespace on the left side only, it is treated as a prefix unary operator. As an example, the ++ operator in a ++b is treated as a prefix unary operator. If an operator has whitespace on the right side only, it is treated as a postfix unary operator. As an example, the ++ operator in a++ b is treated as a postfix unary operator. If an operator has no whitespace on the left but is followed immediately by a dot (.), it is treated as a postfix unary operator. As an example, the ++ operator in a++.b is treated as a postfix unary operator (a++ . b rather than a ++ .b).</p> </blockquote> <p>Excerpt From: Apple Inc. “The Swift Programming Language.” iBooks. <a href="https://itun.es/us/jEUH0.l">https://itun.es/us/jEUH0.l</a></p>
<p>Try adding a space between the <code>=</code> and <code>[</code>. </p> <p>When the equals sign is directly in front of the bracket, the compiler assumes that you are trying to perfom a prefix operation on the array.</p>
<p>Place a space between <code>=</code> and <code>[</code>,</p> <pre><code>let names = ["Anna", "Alex", "Brian", "Jack"] </code></pre> <p>It seems that <code>=[</code> is a reserved operator.</p>
<p>Add a space after the <code>=</code>. (<code>=[</code> looks too sad to be an operator.) It's probably seeing <code>=value</code> as a use of a (possible, but not implemented) prefix operator. </p> <p>Swift isn't entirely whitespace-agnostic like C... in particular, it uses whitespace to distinguish prefix from postfix operators (because <code>++i++</code> in C is a grammar oddity). But it's not ridiculously strict about whitespace like Python either.</p>
