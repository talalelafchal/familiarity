Playground wrong output
<p>I wonder if this is playground bug or it's supposed to work like this:</p> <pre><code>var types = ["0", "1", "2"] // ["0","1","2"] types += "3" // ["0","1","2","3"] types += ["4", "5"] // ["0","1","2","3","4","5"] types[3..5] = ["34"] // ["34"] </code></pre> <p>In my opinion in last line <code>types</code> should contain <code>["0","1","2","34","5"]</code>, however playground gives different output - written on the right.</p> <p>I would consider that on the right we can see only last edited stuff, but in line 2&amp;3 we can see whole types array.</p> <p>In assistant editor I get <code>[0] "34"</code>, while it should be <code>[3] "34"</code> and rest of array in my opinion.</p>
<p><code>var</code> refers to the <strong>mutable content</strong> and also you'r re assigning the values to it .</p> <p><code>types[]</code> - new value at index , mean it shouldn't be concatenate .</p> <p>For Ex :</p> <pre><code>var types = ["0", "1", "2"] types += "5" types += ["4", "5"] types[3..5] = ["34"] // Here considering the index of 3..5 (3 &amp; 4) as one index - Assigning a single value and replaced with the value types </code></pre> <p><img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/Ao7WF.png" alt="enter image description here"></p>
<p>The reason you are seeing only <code>["34"]</code> after the <code>types[3..&lt;5] = ["34"]</code> line is because the assignment operator <code>=</code> returns the value that has been assigned. </p> <p>The other lines show the whole array because the <code>+=</code> operator returns the result of the assignment.</p>
