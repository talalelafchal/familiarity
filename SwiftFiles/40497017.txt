Segues and transmitting data between UI Views. [Map Kit]
I am very new to swift so if you could explain this to me simply that would be great. I am trying to build an app with map kit that will have around 20 pins with different locations. So far, I have managed to create a pin with an annotation, stating its name, a subtitle and a info button. Now I am trying to get the "info" button to link to a second UI view. Currently I only have it coded to print text as shown below: func mapView(_ mapView: MKMapView, annotationView view: MKAnnotationView, calloutAccessoryControlTapped control: UIControl){ if control == view.rightCalloutAccessoryView { print("Button taaped ") } I need to know how I can link the button to open a new UI I have created in the main story board, that will have different pictures, title and description depending on which pin is clicked. If someone could explain this simply I would be very grateful Thanks
create segue between both view controllers, and give it an identifier again from storyboard, then in your code instead of print, call perform segue with identifier function and pass the identifier string exactly as you typed it in the storyboard
On the calloutAccessoryControlTapped: you can call: func mapView(_ mapView: MKMapView, annotationView view: MKAnnotationView, calloutAccessoryControlTapped control: UIControl){ if control == view.rightCalloutAccessoryView { performSegue(withIdentifier: "segue for otherView identifier", sender: view) } you going to send your annotationView to prepareForSegue. After that you implement the method prepareForSegue: override func prepareForSegue(segue: UIStoryboardSegue, sender: AnyObject?) { if segue.identifier == "segue for otherView identifier" { let annotationView = sender as! MKAnnotationView let otherView = segue.destinationViewController as! OtherviewController otherView.image = annotationView.image otherView.title = annotationView.annotation?.title otherView.description = annotationView.annotation?.subtitle } } You just need to make sure that on your otherViewController you have all the attributes that you want to receive form the other view (image, title, description)
