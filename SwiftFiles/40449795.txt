How do you create an iOS liveView in Xcode 8/Swift 3
I can't figure out how to create and display a live view in an Xcode 8/Swift 3 Playground. If Apple has comprehensive documentation on playgrounds and live views, I can't find it, and all my searching online reveals either tutorials on Xcode 7 or the new iPad playgrounds. The few examples I have found set up Mac OS views, which is not what I want (I work mostly in iOS, so the code I want to test out is iOS code, dealing with iOS view hierarchies.) Can somebody give me the bare minimum setup to create a live view and install views into it from an Xcode 8 playground? Then, can somebody point me to some good documentation on playgrounds, and how you configure and use them?
It works like this: import UIKit import PlaygroundSupport let view = UIView(frame: CGRect(x: 0, y: 0, width: 50, height: 50)) view.backgroundColor = UIColor.red PlaygroundPage.current.liveView = view Unfortunately I'm not aware of a good documentation. But I believe there is a book by Erica Sadun about Playgrounds.
