Quiz app, how to add 1 when user choses A or B with a Segmented Control
I have a quiz type app when you can chose A or B. I want to +1 to the score of A or B when the user has finished the app (for example they chose 14 A and 12 B). I'm trying to achieve this with a segmented control however nothing adds to the score. I was thinking maybe I should use buttons but I don't want the user to press the button twice and add +2 to the score only 1 per question. Please see my code below and suggest what I can do, thanks! func personalityTypeCalculator() { if cell.segmentedController.selectedSegmentIndex == 0 { E + 1 } else { if cell.segmentedController.selectedSegmentIndex == 1 { I + 1 } else { return } } }
Your issue: You are not incrementing the value. The result of E+1 is not actually saved in the variable. You should do e = e + 1, or shorter e += 1 Some extra comments about your code: Don't capitalize your variable names It's cleaner to use switch instead of multiple if-else statements: switch cell.segementedControl.selectedSegmentIndex { case 0: e += 1 case 1: i += 1 default: break } segementedController is not really a controller, right? Name it accordingly: segementedControl or something more specific.
It appears you're missing a reference, either to this cell, or to the segmented control. Add a breakpoint to the line you are crashing on so you can see the memory at that point. A window will appear at the bottom of Xcode similar to this: If you only have the console output, click the button highlighted in the bottom right corner to open the memory stack as well. Expand the "self" item, and find "cell". If it has a nil value, you need to make sure you're storing the reference to this cell when you instantiate it. If cell has a memory address, but you expand it and "segmentedControl" is nil, you need to make sure to store the reference to your segmentedControl on the Cell. Additionally, it'd be best if you set up an action with a sender id, which will be the segmentedControl, so you don't need to worry about references like this. segmentedControl.addTarget(self, action: "action:", forControlEvents: .ValueChanged) Basically, replace "action:" with "personalityTypeCalculator:", and pass in sender with type id to the function. Cast sender to type UISegmentedControl, since you know that's what's triggering the action, and you can access theselectedSegment` property from there.
