What is the Sink protocol in swift?
<p>The Swift header has the Sink protocol defined as</p> <pre><code>protocol Sink { typealias Element func put(x: Element) } </code></pre> <p>What is the Sink protocol, what should it be used for regarding Swift and Cocoa design patterns?</p> <p>The only thing that I can tell that implements this protocol is</p> <pre><code>struct IntEncoder : Sink { var asInt: UInt64 var shift: UInt64 func put(x: CodeUnit) } </code></pre>
<p>A sink (as in "kitchen sink") represents the consumer side of a producer/consumer pair. It's an abstract interface that merely accepts some sort of input. Anything that produces objects can therefore be given a <code>Sink</code> as a way to deliver the objects. This is the least amount of knowledge the producer needs to have about the consumer to pass the objects.</p> <p>Queues and sets are examples of simple sinks that just store the input. A network connection or a logger could act as sinks that immediately process the input.</p>
