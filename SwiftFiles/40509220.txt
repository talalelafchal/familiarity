Firebase Crash Report - Run Script issue
i am facing issue with uploading symbol files with Firebase Crash Report. i got 920 warnings state "warning: dump_syms:XXX.app.dSYM/Contents/Resources/DWARF/AWW, architecture : warning: function at offset 0x127547 has no name". i searched a lot in google. but unfourtunately did not get any working solutions or workaround. My script to upload symbol file is like: Replace this with the GOOGLE_APP_ID from your GoogleService-Info.plist file GOOGLE_APP_ID=1:my:app:id Replace the /Path/To/ServiceAccount.json with the path to the key you just downloaded "${PODS_ROOT}"/FirebaseCrash/upload-sym "/Path/To/ServiceAccount.json". i tried to download dSYMs from xcode organizer. it showed like "No dSYMS were found for version". i do not know the exact problem. http://stackoverflow.com/questions/7088771/iphone-where-the-dsym-file-is-located-in-crash-report https://groups.google.com/forum/#!topic/firebase-talk/qIOziP-UPag FYI: Am using Xcode 8 (swift 3). downloaded firebase with cocoapods. Thanks
