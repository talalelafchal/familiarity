BLE in data transmission, need to put the time into 7 byte, the 2016 converted to hexadecimal other unchangedï¼Œhow to convert "2016" to [0x07,0xe0]
2016 becomes 0x7E0 in hexadecimal, so you just need to split higher byte and lower byte. Seems to be a step-1 exercise of the C-language. func getYearBytes(year: Int) -> [UInt8] { let yearByte0 = UInt8(year>>8) let yearByte1 = UInt8(year & 0xFF) return [yearByte0, yearByte1] } print(getYearBytes(year: 2016)) //-> [7, 224] (in decimal) ([0x07, 0xE0] in hexadecimal)
