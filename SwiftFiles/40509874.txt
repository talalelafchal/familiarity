Self-sizing cells and NSFetchedResultsController - very slow update
I have a table view with self sizing cells with NSFetchedResultsController as data source. The problem is if i delete some entry (with swipe to delete) or update it the reloading of the table view is very slow - like 10 sec. I set all delegate methods correctly. What i observed is that if table is set for self sizing cells like: logEntriesTableView.estimatedRowHeight = 80 logEntriesTableView.rowHeight = UITableViewAutomaticDimension its very slow. But if its working with fixed sized cells for example: //logEntriesTableView.estimatedRowHeight = 80 logEntriesTableView.rowHeight = 80 There is no lag at all. I guess the table view is trying to calculate its content size and that its very slow because the list of entries is arround 15 000. If someone knows how to prevent the lag it will be nice.
