What does Swift mean for people learning iOS development for the first time
<p>I quit my job to pursue programming full time and I was planning to take an ios app development course at a college near me that teaches iphone &amp; ipad dev using Objective C. Now that Swift has been released it seems like learning obj C isn't the best choice any more. Apple is saying that swift is supposed to be easier for newbies to learn but as of right now there are no courses or tutorials to learn it. I have downloaded the swift ibook and it is not beginner friendly AT ALL, its more about teaching you the language and doesn't include any kind of examples of how you implement it to make an actual app. As a beginner where should I start when it comes to learning to develop apps with Swift? Is taking an objective C class still worth it?</p>
<p>Taking classes in Objective C might be Worth it, mostly because all programming languages are basically the same, so by learning a bit about it, chances are that you might understand the SWIFT manual better. Swift has many simularities with Objective C and Objective C code can be used in Swift. </p> <p>Happy programming!</p>
