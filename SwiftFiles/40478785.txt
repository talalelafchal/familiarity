NSMutableURLRequest: NSURLErrorDomain Code=-1005 due to HTTP Header that is too long in length?
I have a POST request made using NSMutableURLRequest that failed whenever I use a long String value for my "Authorization" HTTP Header Field. The error code was: Error Domain=NSURLErrorDomain Code=-1005 "The network connection was lost." But whenever I shorten the String length, it successfully connects to the server and returns a response. I'm using an iPhone simulator running on iOS 8.4 and Xcode 7.3.1. (Reason: This project which I'm debugging was written by someone else using Swift 2.x, so I have no choice but to downgrade my Xcode and simulator version to compile and run it. It can't even run on my iOS 10 test device) Any idea as to why this happened? Note: Not a duplication to existing threads as I have tried all options: restarted and reset the simulator, clean the project, re-compile, etc. Plus, I don't even need to restart the simulator, I just need to shorten the length of the header then it works!
