Learning to code on iOS - swift vs Objective C dilemna
<p>I have just finished a year of university and learnt how to write nice applications with C++, OpenGL and Qt. </p> <p>I was just about to start learning Objective C and Cocoa. This seemed optimal to develop iOS &amp; Mac apps since Objective C was, like C++, a variant of C, Cocoa would allow me to make nice UIs and I could continue using my good OpenGL knowledge to do 3d graphics.</p> <p>However, Apple has recently announced that many things are changing. Most importantly, they have announced that there is a new language called "Swift", and that they are replacing (from what I understand) OpenGL with "Metal"</p> <p><strong>My question is</strong>, taking into account the lack of good books/comprehensive tutorials (I had found a great one for Objective C and Cocoa).<br> At this stage, should I wait for the release of XCode6 and iOS8 in fall, along with what I hope will be new books and tutorials on learning this new language and do something else in the meantime to avoid learning a defunct language, or should I learn Objective C anyway and then learn Swift when it comes out (and all these new things like Metal etc). </p> <p>Is it worth deepening my OpenGL understanding in light of all this new stuff being announced?</p>
<p>I would advise learning Swift. It is proving to be popular, and there are some tutorials out already, such as this one (<a href="http://ios-blog.co.uk/tutorials/developing-ios-apps-using-swift-part-1/" rel="nofollow">http://ios-blog.co.uk/tutorials/developing-ios-apps-using-swift-part-1/</a>). Learning Objective-C will probably only be useful for a couple months, as Apple will probably push Swift as the main language. You can also get a good tutorial book by Apple on the iBooks store for free. Also, if you are a registered developer, you can get Xcode 6 and ios 8 now.</p>
