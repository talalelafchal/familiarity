How do I give a UITextView focus programatically?
<p>So I want to bring in a modal view controller that has a UITextView in it and I want the keyboard to automatically popup and the UITextView have focus.</p> <p>I found a way to accomplish this by doing the following:</p> <pre><code>textView.editable = YES; textView.editable = NO; </code></pre> <p>This just seems hacky to me, is there another way? </p>
<p>Since <code>UITextView</code> inherits from <code>UIResponder</code> (indirectly, it actually inherits from <code>UIScrollView</code>, which inherits from <code>UIView</code> which <em>then</em> inherits from <code>UIResponder</code>) you can call the <code>-becomeFirstResponder</code> method on your text field, which will cause it to become the first responder and begin editing:</p> <pre><code>[textView becomeFirstResponder]; </code></pre>
<p>That does seem somewhat hackish.</p> <p>The Cocoa Touch terminology for 'having focus' is 'first responder' and <code>UITextView</code>s will display their keyboards when they are the first responder. I can think of several techniques to make the UITextView become the first responder, but the easiest is probably in your view controller's viewWillAppear or viewDidAppear methods:</p> <pre> - (void)viewWillAppear:(BOOL)animated { [myTextView becomeFirstResponder]; [super viewWillAppear:animated]; } </pre>
<pre><code>[textView becomeFirstResponder]; </code></pre>
<p>Swift:</p> <pre><code>textView.becomeFirstResponder() </code></pre>
