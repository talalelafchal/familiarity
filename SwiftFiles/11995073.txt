Starting Position of NSSplitView divider
<p>How can I set the start position of a NSSplitView?</p> <p>The closest thing I've found that looks like it would work is setPosition</p> <pre><code>//Set splitView position. [splitView setPosition:330 ofDividerAtIndex:0]; </code></pre> <p>This doesn't seem to do anything though, my splitview still starts with the divider in the center.</p> <p>ANy ideas?</p>
<p>Maybe that is the center? If splitView is correctly hooked up to your split view, that code should work. You should probably log [splitView minPossiblePositionOfDividerAtIndex:0] and [splitView maxPossiblePositionOfDividerAtIndex:0] before trying to set the position of the divider so you know the possible values.</p>
<p><code>NSSplitView</code> needs initial non-sized bounds to make them layout correctly. If your view has zero-size, then it will not show expected layout.</p> <p>The best way is providing non-zero layout (this is what IB does), but sometimes this is impossible. </p> <p>If you cannot provide non-zero size, then I think you have to provide proper <code>- (void)splitView:(NSSplitView *)splitView resizeSubviewsWithOldSize:(NSSize)oldSize</code> delegate method implementation to layout everything manually yourself. (this is my current best practice)</p>
<p>You don't set the position of the divider, you set the sizes of your NSSplitView's subviews. The divider is then repositioned automatically.</p> <p>This is how I positioned my divider and subview size (in swift):</p> <pre><code>let subview: NSView = mySplitView.subviews[1] as NSView subview.setFrameSize(NSMakeSize(subview.frame.size.width, 100)) </code></pre>
