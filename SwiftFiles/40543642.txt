Resizable and Rearrangable CollectionView Cell with Image: Swift or Obj-C
My CollectionView Cell has only Image in it. I want to resize that image by user, and while resizing the image all the cell should automatically rearrange (I have fixed image count i. e. 22): I have used flow layout for collection view but limitation is that needs fixed number of height/width. I have added resized library separately. I Tried by searching many libraries and doing so many demos but not able to get the required output. I want you to suggest me either the way should i go with or If you have done such kind of stuff then your thought are welcome. Thank you in advance.
