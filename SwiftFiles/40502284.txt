Google Tag Manager Container not found ios swift
I am currently trying to include Google Tag Manager in my iOS application (using Xcode 8 and Swift 3) but XCode somehow cannot find the container. I followed the steps written in the official Google Document here. The error I got was: GoogleTagManager warning: Cannot find binary resource file 'GTM-xxxxJ'. GoogleTagManager warning: Cannot find resource file 'GTM-xxxxJ.plist'. GoogleTagManager warning: Cannot find resource file 'GTM-xxxxJ.json'. GoogleTagManager error: No default container found; creating an empty container. I have published the container and am running the new version of the it, yet seem to get the above error.
Fixed the problem by creating a new container and choosing "iOS(Legacy)" instead of "Firebase". As I am using Google Tag Manager to access Google Analytics, I had to actually use the "iOS(Legacy)" setting.
