GoogleToolboxForMac framework error
I try to add the Google Analytics into my project, but I see the error: ld: framework not found GoogleToolboxForMac clang: error: linker command failed with exit code 1 (use -v to see invocation) I've already tried to Clean my project, tried deleting Derived Data, tried adding pod 'GoogleToolboxForMac/Logger' to the Podfile, tried removing and re-adding the Pod. However, nothing helps. I saw all the suggestions from another similar topics on Stackoverflow. What may cause the described error and how can I fix it?
To eliminate linker errors I had to add 3 libraries, via {projectName} > Build Phases > Link Binary With Libraries: Add Other > {projectName} > Pods > GoogleAnalytics > Libraries > libGoogleAnalytics.a iOS 10.0 > CoreData.Framework iOS 10.0 > libsqlite3.tbd
