Different section header depending on section in collection view
I have a collection view that needs to display a different kind of header depending on which section for my collection view. However, when I add my second reusable view to my storyboard, it automatically takes that as my footer view. Is there any way I can have two different section header for my collection view?
You will have to do it programatically to dequeue the headerView programatically. Something like the below will help you: override func collectionView(_ collectionView: UICollectionView, viewForSupplementaryElementOfKind kind: String, at indexPath: IndexPath) -> UICollectionReusableView { switch kind { case UICollectionElementKindSectionHeader: var headerView = collectionView.dequeueReusableSupplementaryView(ofKind: kind, withReuseIdentifier: "HeaderOne", for: indexPath) as! HeaderOneView if sectionTwo { headerView = collectionView.dequeueReusableSupplementaryView(ofKind: kind, withReuseIdentifier: "HeaderTwo", for: indexPath) as! HeaderTwoView } return headerView default: assert(false, "Unexpected element kind") } } Also you might have to use this function register(_:forSupplementaryViewOfKind:withReuseIdentifier:) to register a view that is created not via storyboard.
