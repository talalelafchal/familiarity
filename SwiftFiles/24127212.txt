SKShapeNode(circleOfRadius) results in &quot;unrecognized selector sent to class&quot; in Playground for OSX
<p>The following playground results in a timeline error "unrecognized selector sent to class..."</p> <pre><code>import SpriteKit let node = SKShapeNode(circleOfRadius: 10) </code></pre> <p><a href="http://i.imgur.com/erIbSIB.png?1">Screenshot</a></p> <p>Seems to work ok when platform is iOS. Running 10.9.3</p>
<p>It's because you're running it on an OS X version that's older than the API you're trying to use. The code you're using requires OS X 10.10, or iOS 8 and up.</p> <p>The <a href="https://developer.apple.com/library/prerelease/mac/documentation/General/Reference/APIDiffsMacOSX10_10SeedDiff/index.html">OS X 10.10 API Differences</a> confirm that all of SKShapeNodes custom initializers have just been added in 10.10. Previously, all we could do with SKShapeNode, was initialize an instance, and then modify its <code>path</code> property.</p>
