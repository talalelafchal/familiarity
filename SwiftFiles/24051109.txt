How to Determine Swift Inferred Type in Xcode 6
<p>Say I have something like</p> <p><code>let a = &lt;some-complicated-expression&gt;</code></p> <p>Is there any way within Xcode to check which type the compiler has inferred for <code>a</code>?</p> <p><strong>EDIT</strong>: \</p> <p>For example, in the Eclipse Scala IDE, by hovering over the variable name the editor would show the inferred type</p>
<p>Yes. Alt click the variable and you'll get a pop over with the type.</p> <p><img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/x65cF.png" alt="enter image description here"></p>
