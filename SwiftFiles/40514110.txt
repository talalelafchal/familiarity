How to resize an image inside an UIButton?
I have this UIButton and an image to fit in. I don't want that the image take all the space inside the button but just a little part of it right in the center, but if I resize the button it will resize the image too. How can I do that, is there an option to set whatever dimension I want independently from the size of the UIButton? Thanks!
I would do it this way: A UIButton is just a UIView. You can simply add a UIImageView with a set image and call addSubview on the UIButton. You should also set userInteractionEnabled to false on the UIImageView.
You can experiment with image view insets. Every UIButton has a property imageView. In Swift 3 you can do this like so: //let button = UIButton() button.imageView?.backgroundColor = UIColor.red button.imageEdgeInsets = UIEdgeInsetsMake(10, 10, 10, 10) red background is just so you know what is changing
This can be done through code in the following way: let imageSize:CGSize = CGSize(width: 20, height: 20) let button:UIButton = UIButton(type: UIButtonType.custom) button.frame = CGRect(x: 200, y: 200, width: 60, height: 60) button.backgroundColor = UIColor.yellow button.setImage(UIImage(named: "chat.png"), for: UIControlState.normal) // The below line will give you what you want button.imageEdgeInsets = UIEdgeInsetsMake(button.frame.size.height/2 - imageSize.height/2, button.frame.size.width/2 - imageSize.width/2, button.frame.size.height/2 - imageSize.height/2, button.frame.size.width/2 - imageSize.width/2) self.view.addSubview(button) This way, you can achieve what you wanted.
