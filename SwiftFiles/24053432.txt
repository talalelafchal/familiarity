Int vs Integer in Swift
<p>Does anyone know what the difference is between these two types?</p> <p>The docs only refer to <code>Int</code> but Xcode 6 auto complete only gives me <code>Integer</code> when I type. I started using <code>Integer</code> when porting code only to find that you have to cast between the two types.</p> <p>For instance the following code gives the error <em>Could not find an overload for '+' that accepts the supplied arguments</em>.</p> <pre><code>var number1 : Int = 5 var number2 : Integer = 10 number1 + number2 </code></pre>
<p>An <code>Int</code> is the type whilst an <code>Integer</code> is a protocol it implements.</p> <p>You should be using <code>Int</code> in declarations, i.e:</p> <pre><code>var num: Int = 5 </code></pre> <p>which is also the type that's inferred for integer literals when a type isn't specified, i.e:</p> <pre><code>var num = 5 </code></pre>
