Is Swift good for iOS Game development?
<p>I am new with Swift concept and its usage for apps/game development. </p> <p>Does swift or xcode 6 beta include the tool for Game development ?</p>
<p>Xcode 6 and iOS 8 includes SceneKit (3D) and SpriteKit (2D) for game development.</p> <p>Documentation is here: <a href="https://developer.apple.com/library/mac/documentation/3DDrawing/Conceptual/SceneKit_PG/Introduction/Introduction.html" rel="nofollow">https://developer.apple.com/library/mac/documentation/3DDrawing/Conceptual/SceneKit_PG/Introduction/Introduction.html</a></p> <p><a href="https://developer.apple.com/library/ios/documentation/GraphicsAnimation/Conceptual/SpriteKit_PG/Introduction/Introduction.html" rel="nofollow">https://developer.apple.com/library/ios/documentation/GraphicsAnimation/Conceptual/SpriteKit_PG/Introduction/Introduction.html</a></p>
<p>You can use the same APIs that were available in Objective-C in Swift. So yes, it is "good" for game development.</p>
