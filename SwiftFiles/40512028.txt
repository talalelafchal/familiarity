Comparing Images via pixels
I was playing around with images and came across a little game I tried to create. You see an Image (for simplicity let's say a circle) and you have to redraw the circle as exact as possible on top of it. All of that works in my little project already. I want to be able to tell how many % of the image was recreated correctly (and again for simplicity no colours needed. It's always black and white) Could I just count the the black pixels overlaying the image subtract the ones that are not and divide it by the amount of black pixels in the original? This would look like this I guess: ratio = (correctPixelCount - wrongPixelCount) / originalPixelCount If yes, how would I go about getting each pixel and compare them? If no, what else could I do? PS: I already tried a Image compare cocoa pod called AIImageCompare. Unfortunately it crashes for some unknown reasons. Thank you!
