Multiplying integers
<p>I am certain I am missing something very, very obvious, but can anyone tell me why I am having trouble multiplying two <code>Integers</code>? The following code:</p> <pre><code>let twenty: Integer = 20 let ten: Integer = 10 let result: Integer = twenty * ten </code></pre> <p>presents the error <code>Could not find an overload for '*' that accepts the supplied arguments</code>.</p> <p>Other questions on SO with the same error are caused by trying to multiply different types together, but surely these are both <code>Integer</code> types?</p> <p>(PS: The actual code I am trying to run is <code>var value = self.value * 10</code> but I have expanded it to the sample while debugging to make absolutely sure that the correct types are being used)</p>
<p>use <code>Int</code> instead. <code>Integer</code> is a protocol.</p>
<p><code>Integer</code> is a protocol not a type. Use <code>Int</code> instead.</p>
<p>As already stated , Integer is a protocol not a type .</p> <p>In your situation, you don't need to do explicit the type because it is of implicit casting. </p> <p>This could be enough</p> <pre><code> let twenty = 20 let ten = 10 let result = twenty * ten NSLog("%d", result) </code></pre>
