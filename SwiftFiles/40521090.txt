App crashes on all button click event while I move from Swift 2.2 to 3.0 and also from Xcode 7.0 to 8.0
I am having wired issue with my existing project. Its crashing my app in all button click event. My project is 1 year Old build with Xcode 7.0 and Swift 2.2 and now I am working with latest Xcode 8.0 & Swift 3.0. Button Action code: @IBAction func symbol3Tapped(sender: UIButton) { hideView(view: sender) { self.currency3 = self.nextCurrency(currency: self.currency3) self.showView(view: sender, completion: { }) } } I have just run my application and while I am clicking in any of button on my screen its crashing with below reason. [SwiftRates.MenuViewController symbol2Tapped:]: unrecognized selector sent to instance 0x7fe15a400da0 Based on crash log its clearly shows that there is no such kind of action symbol2Tapped: in my project but its already there and previously working fine with older version. Please let me know if I miss any step to upgrade my project to latest version. Any help will be appreciated. Thanks in advance.
