How does let x where x.hasSuffix(&quot;pepper&quot;) work
<p>In the code block below, I am having trouble understanding <code>let x where x.hasSuffix("pepper")</code>.</p> <pre><code>let vegetable = "red pepper" switch vegetable { case "celery": let vegetableComment = "Add some raisins and make ants on a log." case "cucumber", "watercress": let vegetableComment = "That would make a good tea sandwhich" case let x where x.hasSuffix("pepper"): let vegetableComment = "Is it a spicy \(x)" default: let vegetableComment = "Everything tastes good in soup." } </code></pre> <blockquote> <p>Console output</p> <p><strong>vegetableComment:</strong> Is it a spicy red pepper</p> </blockquote> <p>It seems like the following logic is happening.</p> <pre><code>x = vegetable if (x's suffix == 'pepper') run case </code></pre> <p>Can someone explain this better for me?</p>
<p><code>vegetable</code> is an implicit <code>String</code>. It's the same as you would write:</p> <pre><code>var vegetable: String = "red pepper" </code></pre> <p><code>hasSuffix</code> is declared as <code>func hasSuffix(suffix: String) -&gt; Bool</code> an therefore returns a <code>Bool</code>. The <code>where</code> keyword specifies additional requirements, and can only be used in <code>switch</code> statements. <br /> Because all of this is suffused, the <code>vegetable</code> variable is assigned to x (<code>let x</code>).</p> <p>You can read more about the <code>where</code> and <code>switch</code> <a href="https://developer.apple.com/library/prerelease/ios/documentation/Swift/Conceptual/Swift_Programming_Language/ControlFlow.html#//apple_ref/doc/uid/TP40014097-CH9-XID_153">here</a>.</p>
