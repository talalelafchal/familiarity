Instagram Login is not redirecting to my registered URI if I use UIWebView
I was using a couple of weeks ago Instagram login using a UIWebView for redirecting to my URI. I don't know what's wrong but it's not redirecting anymore. But if I use SFSafariViewController it does but I don't see any method to catch the current url so I guess it's not worth for this case, cause I need to grab the auth code. What's happening? Why UIWebView ended working from one day to other? This is my code for making the redirect and request the auth code: webViewOutlet.loadRequest(URLRequest(url: URL(string: "https://api.instagram.com/oauth/authorize/?client_id=MY_CLIENT_ID&redirect_uri=http://localhost&response_type=code")!, cachePolicy: .reloadIgnoringCacheData)) If I type that url into my Mac Safari it redirects. If I do it in SFSafariViewController it does it too. Any suggestion?
