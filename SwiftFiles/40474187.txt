Confusion regarding NSScanner (Scanner)
I wrote an extension to return a UIColor from a hexadecimal string. Although it works, I don't quite understand the purpose of this piece of code var rgbValue: UInt32 = 0 Scanner(string: cleanHexStr).scanHexInt32(&rgbValue) Could you provide some insight/detailed understanding for this? Thank you.
The first part creates a instance of NSScanner for the string cleanHexString. (Scanners are "attached" to a string.) Then scanHexInt32() is executed on this scanner to get the integer value of the string representation. rgbValue is an out-argument. (The pointer to it is passed, what is the technique for out-arguments in C. NSScanner is an Objective-C class.)
