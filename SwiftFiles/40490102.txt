Assign one enum Type to another enum Type
How we can typecast a variable of one enum type to another. I have two Int Enum. And when i create a variable of type First enum and assign some value from second it doesn't allow me. How we can achieve that? Below is the code  enum Sections: Int { case initiateZero = 0 case Air case Weight } enum SubSections: Int { case MaxPath = 0 case Weight case FullWeight } For getting them. var section = Sections.initiateZero if isLongForm { section = Sections(rawValue: indexPath.section)! } else { section = SubSections (rawValue: indexPath.section) } Not able to assign them. Please Suggest
I can not think of valid usecase, but you might want to use its rawValues: enum Enum1: Int { case one = 0 case two = 1 } enum Enum2: Int { case one = 0 case two = 1 } let enum1 = Enum1.one let enum2 = Enum2(rawValue: enum1.rawValue) print(enum2) prints: Optional(Enum2.one)
