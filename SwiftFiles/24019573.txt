UIButton title not displaying
<p><br/> I just started developing in Swift.</p> <p>I created an UIButton dynamically and added it to the View. My issue is the view is not displaying the button.</p> <p><strong>My Code:</strong></p> <pre><code>var button:UIButton = UIButton(); button.frame = CGRect(x: 100, y: 250, width: 100, height: 50); button.setTitle("Midhun", forState: UIControlState.Normal); self.view.addSubview(button); </code></pre> <p>Then I added image to the button and then it is showing:</p> <pre><code>button.setImage(UIImage(named: "step_first.jpg"), forState: UIControlState.Normal); </code></pre> <p>I couldn't figure out what is happening. Please help</p>
<p>I actually figured out the issue.</p> <p>In Swift the title of <code>UIButton</code> is white.</p> <p>I changed the background color of parent View, now it is showing.</p> <pre><code>self.view.backgroundColor = UIColor.blackColor(); </code></pre>
<p>For me the issue was that I wasn't using the setter methods. </p> <p>I was doing <code>notificationsButton.titleLabel?.text = "x"</code> instead of <code>notificationsButton.setTitle("x", forState: UIControlState.Normal) </code></p>
<p>In case you subclass UIButton and override its <code>layoutSubviews()</code>, make sure you call <code>super.layoutSubviews()</code> inside</p>
