initWithDelegate for Objective-C class
I have import this Objective-C class in a swift project. MMLANSCanner.h #import <Foundation/Foundation.h> @class Device; @protocol MMLANScannerDelegate; @protocol MMLANScannerDelegate <NSObject> @required - (void)lanScanDidFinishScanningWithStatus:(MMLanScannerStatus)status; - (void)lanScanDidFailedToScan; @optional - (void)lanScanProgressPinged:(float)pingedHosts from:(NSInteger)overallHosts; @end #pragma mark - Public methods @interface MMLANScanner : NSObject -(instancetype)initWithDelegate:(id <MMLANScannerDelegate>)delegate; @property(nonatomic,weak) id<MMLANScannerDelegate> delegate; @property(nonatomic,assign,readonly)BOOL isScanning; - (void)start; - (void)stop; @end I successfully created the bridging header and make the MainVC.Swift to conform to MMLANScannerDelegate. Then I tried to initialise the MMLanScanner with delegate self. import UIKit import Foundation class MainVC: UIViewController, MMLANScannerDelegate { var presenter = MMLANScanner(delegate:self) override func viewDidLoad() { super.viewDidLoad() // Do any additional setup after loading the view. } override func didReceiveMemoryWarning() { super.didReceiveMemoryWarning() // Dispose of any resources that can be recreated. } func lanScanDidFindNewDevice(_ device: Device!) { } func lanScanDidFailedToScan() { } func lanScanDidFinishScanning(with status: MMLanScannerStatus) { } func lanScanProgressPinged(_ pingedHosts: Float, from overallHosts: Int) { } } But I get error: Argument passed to call that takes no arguments Any ideas how to implement initWithDelegate function that I had in Objective-C?
MLANScanner doesn't take a delegate argument to its init method (delegate is a property of MLANScanner). You also have a problem with the definition of your presenter property since self isn't valid at the time MainVC is created. Do this instead: let presenter = MLANScanner() override func viewDidLoad() { super.viewDidLoad() presenter.delegate = self } based on edit to question: var presenter: MLANScanner! override func viewDidLoad() { super.viewDidLoad() presenter = MLANScanner(delegate: self) } Note: My edited answer assumes there is a Swift bridge somewhere that exposes an init(delegate:) method. There may not be and making one is beyond the scope of this question. Since the delegate is not private or read-only you can almost certainly use the first version I posted.
