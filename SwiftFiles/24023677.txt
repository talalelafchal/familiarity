How to move to multiple view controllers?
<p>I want to programmatically move from a viewController to another using Apple's new Swift language. I've googled and read through the docs, and I see how to use a single ViewController. Does anyone have an example or documentation on how to switch between View Controllers?</p>
<p>There are many ways to do this detailed in the class documentation for <code>UIViewController</code>. </p> <p><strong>Example 1</strong> Here is an example of using the <code>-presentViewConroller:</code> method (assuming this code is written in a <code>UIViewController</code> subclass):</p> <pre><code>var secondViewController = UIViewController() //create your second view controller. self.presentViewController(secondViewController, true, NULL) </code></pre> <hr> <p><strong>Example 2</strong> This is how you would present the second <code>UIViewController</code> via storyboards (again assuming this code is written in a <code>UIViewController</code> subclass):</p> <pre><code>self.preformSegueWithIdentifier("segueIdentfier", self); </code></pre> <hr>
