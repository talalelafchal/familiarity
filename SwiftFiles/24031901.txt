Could not find an overload for '-' that accepts the supplied arguments
<p>I am just playing around with Swift for the first time and I do not understand why this does not work. Any help would be great!</p> <p>I get the error <strong>could not find an overload for '-' that accepts the supplied arguments</strong> </p> <p>for the line that says <strong>self.health = self.health - amount</strong></p> <pre><code>class human { var name:String var height:Integer var hairColor:String var health:Integer init(name:String, height:Integer, hairColor:String) { self.name = name self.height = height self.hairColor = hairColor self.health = 100 } func applyDamage(amount:Integer) -&gt; Integer{ self.health = self.health - amount return self.health } } </code></pre> <p>Thank you!</p>
<p>Use <code>Int</code>, not <code>Integer</code>.</p> <p><code>Integer</code> is a protocol, not the type.</p>
<p>I think you may have meant to use Int instead of Integer. This code works fine:</p> <pre><code>class human { var name:String var height:Int var hairColor:String var health:Int init(name:String, height:Int, hairColor:String) { self.name = name self.height = height self.hairColor = hairColor self.health = 100 } func applyDamage(amount:Int) -&gt; Int{ self.health = self.health - amount return self.health } } </code></pre>
<p>To explain the actual error message, Swift is trying to apply the '-' operator to an <strong>Integer</strong> and an <strong>Integer</strong>, but you have not overloaded the '-' operator. This is why the error is worded as it is. The '-' operators works in the case of an <strong>Int</strong> and an <strong>Int</strong>, which was obviously your intention in this instance, so you simply need to use <strong>Int</strong> instead of <strong>Integer</strong></p>
<p>For what it is worth, you might want to do</p> <pre><code>self.health -= amount </code></pre> <p>instead of</p> <pre><code>self.health = self.health - amount </code></pre> <p>to be more idiomatic</p>
