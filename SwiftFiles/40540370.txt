Importing text and images swift Map Kit
I am trying to get specific images and text files to imbed into my second view controller based on which pin is selected in my Map View. Currently I have my title being transferred through a segue. my thought was to name the text files and images the same as the title so they would be correctly selected when the title was found. EG: Title = big ben : title = "big ben" hence select image title.png and title.txt However I am having trouble implementing this as I am unsure how to tell swift to select an image and text file from the assets folder. I currently have the segue and prepare for segue implemented as: func mapView(_ mapView: MKMapView, annotationView view: MKAnnotationView, calloutAccessoryControlTapped control: UIControl) { if control == view.rightCalloutAccessoryView { if let artworkPin = view.annotation as? Artwork { performSegue(withIdentifier: "no", sender: artworkPin) } } } override func prepare(for segue: UIStoryboardSegue, sender: Any?) { if let identifier = segue.identifier { if identifier == "no" { if let artworkPin = sender as? Artwork { let ViewTwo = segue.destination as! ViewTwo ViewTwo.artworkPin = artworkPin } } } } } and my second view class as: @IBOutlet weak var art_image: UIImageView! @IBOutlet weak var art_desc: UITextView! @IBOutlet weak var art_title: UILabel! var artworkPin: Artwork! override func viewDidLoad() { super.viewDidLoad() art_title.text = artworkPin.title } how can I get swift to pull from the assets folder? I have attached my full code below: ViewControllerOne ViewTwo
when storing non image files in XCAssets, you should use NSDataAsset to acccess their content Reference : https://developer.apple.com/library/ios/documentation/UIKit/Reference/NSDataAsset_Class/  func readBundle(file:String) -> String { var res = "" if let asset = NSDataAsset(name: file) , let string = String(data:asset.data, encoding: String.Encoding.utf8){ res = string } return res } To load the image in second view controller @IBOutlet weak var art_image: UIImageView! @IBOutlet weak var art_desc: UITextView! @IBOutlet weak var art_title: UILabel! var artworkPin: Artwork! override func viewDidLoad() { super.viewDidLoad() art_title.text = readBundle(artworkPin.title) art_image.image = UIImage(named:"PinSample") } Note : Asset image name and name in the code should be same
