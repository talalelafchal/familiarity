Differentiate let and var in Swift Programming Language
<p>I have just started learning new Swift Language, How can we differentiate like when to use <strong>"Let"</strong> and <strong>"Var"</strong>. As i have understanding of Java Script i know while you want to define <strong>"Var"</strong>. How <strong>"Let"</strong> is different than <strong>"Var"</strong>.</p> <p>Any help would be appreciated. </p>
<p>First off... Swift != Javascript</p> <p>The main difference is that <code>var</code> declares a variable and <code>let</code> declares a constant.</p> <p>Like this...</p> <pre><code>var a = 1 // a is instantiated as 1 a = 2 // a is now 2 </code></pre> <p>but this...</p> <pre><code>let a = 1 // a is instantiated as 1 a = 2 // this will return a compile time error </code></pre> <p>There are other smaller things too.</p>
