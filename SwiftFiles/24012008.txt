Swift Playground Stopped Evaluating
<p>I was playing around with the Swift GuidedTour.playground when it stopped showing the evaluation of variables. How can I turn this back on ?</p> <p>It works when I create a new playground. I must have pushed some button to turn this off but cannot turn it back on</p> <p><img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/tkS3J.png" alt="enter image description here"></p> <p>This is the same code on a new playground with evaluations</p> <p><img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/VXkiv.png" alt="enter image description here"></p>
<p>Have you tried to use <strong>Reset PlayGround</strong> in Editor menu? </p> <p><img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/RCTeq.png" alt="enter image description here"></p> <p>And if you have <strong>error in code</strong>, live coding may not work. Always <strong>check the console</strong> after changing your code. </p>
<p>For anyone else, if you have an error it will stop evaluating your code , so fix asn save the file and it will start doing it again</p>
