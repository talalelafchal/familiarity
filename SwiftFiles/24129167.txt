UIVisualEffectView renders differently on different devices
<p>In my <code>ViewController.swift</code>:</p> <pre><code>var img = UIImageView(image: UIImage(named: "puddles")) img.frame = view.bounds; view.addSubview(img); var effect = UIBlurEffect(style: UIBlurEffectStyle.Light) var effectView = UIVisualEffectView(effect: effect) effectView.frame = CGRectMake(0, 0, 500, 500) view.addSubview(effectView) </code></pre> <p>The image as rendered using the code above in the <code>iPad Air</code>, <code>iPhone 5</code>, or <code>iPhone 5S</code> simulators:</p> <p><img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/hBgL5.png" alt="woof, doesn&#39;t that look so good"></p> <p>The image as rendered using the code above in the <code>iPhone 4S</code>, <code>iPad 2</code>, or <code>iPad Retina</code> simulators:</p> <p><img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/mb2dp.png" alt="I can&#39;t see my doge!"></p> <p><em>Note: Both images above were taken from the simulator, but this can be reproduced on actual devices running iOS 8 Beta 1 as well.</em></p> <p>Obviously, I would like to achieve the first effect on all devices. How can I achieve the same first effect on all devices?</p>
<p><code>UIVisualEffectView</code> in iOS 8 does pretty much the same thing as the (formerly private API) translucency and vibrancy effects seen in iOS 7. Like the iOS 7 effects, they fall back to graphically simpler implementations on hardware that can't render such complex graphics effects in realtime.</p>
<p>We hit this issue recently when our Visual Effect View was an ugly grey color on on of our developer's machines.</p> <pre><code>UIVisualEffect *blurEffect = [UIBlurEffect effectWithStyle:UIBlurEffectStyleLight]; UIVisualEffectView *visualEffectView = [[UIVisualEffectView alloc] initWithEffect:blurEffect]; </code></pre> <p>It turns out that they had enabled <code>Low Quality Graphics Override</code> on their iOS Simulator. Turning this option back to <code>Device Default</code> fixes the issue and displays a nice translucent view. </p> <blockquote> <p>iOS Simulator > Menu Bar > Debug > Graphics Quality Override > Device Default</p> </blockquote> <p><a href="https://i.stack.imgur.com/PkyZQ.png" rel="nofollow noreferrer"><img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/PkyZQ.png" alt="Low quality graphics override option in iOS Simulator"></a></p>
