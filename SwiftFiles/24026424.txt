comma at the end of a dictionary - swift
<p>Example code:</p> <pre><code>let interestingNumbers = [ "Prime":[2,3,5,7,11,13], "Fibonacci":[1,1,2,3,5,8], "Square":[1,4,9,16,25]`,` ] </code></pre> <p>Question: after "Square:[1,4,9,16,25]", there is a comma(sample code from Apple Swift reference guide book), when I get rid of it, I didn't get any error messages from Xcode, is this just convention at all ? (I remember there is a <code>nil</code> after array or dictionary in objective-C</p>
<p>This is because a comma after the last element in a dictionary is optional. </p> <p>Consider the simpler example:</p> <pre><code>let letters = ["A":1, "B":2, "C":3 ] </code></pre> <p>A comma placed after the last element, <code>"C":3</code>, is acceptable, but optional.</p> <p>I believe that there is no specific convention regarding the final comma - some may prefer it as it allows you to add items on following lines without modifying the above line to add the comma (makes source control review simpler). I often leave commas on the last element in an <code>enum</code> declaration for the same reason. </p> <p>If you know you are likely to add more elements in the future, then having the comma would simplify the source diff in a code review (one added line instead of one removed line and two added lines). I would use the comma where you know you're going to add elements later, and omit in if the list of items is final.</p>
