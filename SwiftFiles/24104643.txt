Namespaces and modules in the Swift language
<p>I've been experimenting with Swift on my way home from WWDC. One of the most compelling new features of Swift, in my opinion, was namespacing. I haven't managed to get it to work as I expected it should though. Please see the attached screenshot and let me know if you have an idea of what I'm doing wrong.</p> <p><img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/YsHEU.png" alt="Declaring module global function"> <img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/7BKDr.png" alt="Attempting to utilize module function"> EDIT: I have of course tried to remove the import statement.</p>
<p>Turns out that this is a known bug: <a href="https://devforums.apple.com/message/976286#976286" rel="nofollow">https://devforums.apple.com/message/976286#976286</a></p>
<p>I am sorry, if I search for "namespace" or "namespacing" in the Swift-eBook there are no results. Maybe you can give me a link to an additional resource?</p> <p>I would solve your problem simply with a <code>struct</code> and <code>static</code> functions.</p> <h3>ClassA</h3> <pre><code>struct ClassA { static func localize() { println("Localized String") } } </code></pre> <h3>ClassB</h3> <p>You can drop the import and execute the ClassA-function as follows:</p> <pre><code>ClassA.localize() </code></pre> <p><br></p> <h1>The second way</h1> <p>In your case you can also just make an extension of String like so:</p> <pre><code>extension String { func localize() -&gt; String { return self+"-localized" } } println("Test".localize()) // prints "Test-localized" </code></pre>
