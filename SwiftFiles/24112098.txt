How do I pass a Swift class to an Objective-C method needing a Class?
<p>I'm looking to use the Objective-C library <a href="https://github.com/reaster/saxy" rel="nofollow">saxy</a> to parse some XML into objects, however the method signature is:</p> <pre><code>+ (id)rootXPath:(NSString *)xpath toMany:(Class)toType nsURI:(NSString *)nsURI; </code></pre> <p>I'm having trouble working out how I'd pass the Class object type as Swift does not seem to work with classes in this way. As a workaround I will probably make the domain model + a wrapper in Objective-C, but would be good to know if there's a way to do it in pure Swift.</p> <p>I've tried the following, but I get a EXC_BAD_INSTRUCTION:</p> <pre><code>OXmlElementMapper.rootXPath("/route", toMany: Route.self, nsURI: "") </code></pre> <p>and this which produces a syntax error:</p> <pre><code>OXmlElementMapper.rootXPath("/route", toMany: Route.Type, nsURI: "") </code></pre>
<p><code>MyClass.self</code> <em>is</em> the correct way to reference a class, but perhaps you're missing <code>@objc</code> on the class?</p> <p>See <a href="https://developer.apple.com/library/prerelease/ios/documentation/swift/conceptual/buildingcocoaapps/InteractingWithObjective-CAPIs.html#//apple_ref/doc/uid/TP40014216-CH4-XID_36" rel="nofollow">docs regarding interop</a></p>
