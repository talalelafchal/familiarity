Cannot get transparent Tab Bar in tvOS
I'm having a hard time getting a UITabBar with a completely transparent background on tvOS : I Always get a whitish background. I tried the following (Setting background color clear, background image to UIImage) but nothing worked. var appearanceTabBar = UITabBar.appearance() appearanceTabBar.barTintColor = UIColor.clear appearanceTabBar.shadowImage = UIImage() appearanceTabBar.backgroundImage = UIImage() Result is the following : does anybody have any idea on how i can make the background completely transparent ? Setting the color as the same purple is not a good idea as a picture may be on the background. Thank you :) Mickael
