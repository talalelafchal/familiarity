GCSVideoView can't set view mode
I decided that I would dabble a little in VR this week! Using google's VR SDK installed with cocoapods, I was able to quickly put together a simple VR app that loaded a video from a server and displayed it using a GCSVideoView. Alas, I have encountered an issue! I can't seem to change the GCSVideoView's content mode (mono / stereo). Naturally some of my content is not being displayed correctly as the format is, of course, incorrect. A solution would be to just use the default format for my content, but I'd prefer to learn how to change the underlying content property. Looking at the previous version of the SDK, the GVRVideoView allows this property to be changed. In short, anyone know how to change the GCSVideoView's view mode? Thanks!
