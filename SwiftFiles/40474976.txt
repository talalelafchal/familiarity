Detect Index Path from selected AccessoryView?
I'm using accessoryView, not button. This means I can't use the "accessoryButtonTappedForRowWithIndexPath" method. Itried to add a tap gesture recognizer to my view, but it won't work for the following reasons: I need the indexPath of the selected accessoryView, so I can't call a generic "cellAccessoryTapped()" function since it wouldn't have the index path. I can't pass in any parameters into the selector as to pass in my index path. Here is the code for my accessoryView:  let ellipsesImageView = UIImageView(image: UIImage(named: "ellipses-nav-bar-icon")) cell.accessoryView = ellipsesImageView cell.accessoryView?.tintColor = Theme.Color.Primary.primaryBlack cell.accessoryView?.userInteractionEnabled = true let cellTapGestureRecogznier = UITapGestureRecognizer(target: self, action: #selector(self.tableView(_:accessoryButtonTappedForRowWithIndexPath:))) cell.accessoryView?.addGestureRecognizer(cellTapGestureRecogznier) The app crashes when I tap on a cell, and doesn't go into the table view method at all, so I do not think I'm permitted to use it. How would I go about finding the index path of the cell given the selected accessory view?
