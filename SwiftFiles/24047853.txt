include dictionary or array value in swift string with backslash notation
<p>I'm testing out the playground for swift reading the ebook and am testing the backslash insert value into string thing.. wondering how I could do this with a dictionnary array, but it does not seem to like it.</p> <pre><code>var str="dictionary values are \(dict['mine'])" </code></pre> <p>this errors out. just wondering what the correct way to escape this would be, or should I just concatenate them in this case.</p>
<p>As far as I've been able to tell there isn't a way. You just have to break it up onto multiple line, like so:</p> <pre><code>let x = dict["mine"] var str="dictionary values are \(x)" </code></pre>
<p>Single quotes are not allowed as string delimiters in Swift. Additionally the string interpolation does not allow ‘unescaped double quote (") or backslash (\)’, cf. <a href="https://developer.apple.com/library/prerelease/ios/documentation/swift/conceptual/swift_programming_language/StringsAndCharacters.html#//apple_ref/doc/uid/TP40014097-CH7-XID_382" rel="nofollow">The Swift Programming Language</a></p> <p>If you have the key as a constant (or variable) it will work:</p> <pre><code>let key = "mine" let str = "dictionary values are \(dict[key])" </code></pre> <p>As an aside Swift encourages immutability for safety, you should always use <code>let</code> by default and only revert to <code>var</code> if you really need to.</p>
