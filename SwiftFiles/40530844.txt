Swift: Using credentials with Firebase and a additional textfield for username
I have a few things I'm trying to accomplish. First, my email and password don't matter if they're filled or not to login. I would like the app to check if email and password is filled and correct before logging in. Secondly, I would like to put in a username when they register so it would show up on the profile page and tell other users who they're without revealing an email address. I'm using Firebase and I thought this would do the trick, but it doesn't. I looked over this Stack overFlow Post and have everything correct I think, but its still letting you login without credentials. @IBAction func loginRegisterBtnPressed(_ sender: AnyObject) { performSegue(withIdentifier: "profileVC", sender: self) if let email = emailTextField.text, let password = passwordTextField.text { FIRAuth.auth()?.signIn(withEmail: email, password: password, completion: { (user, error ) in if error == nil { print("DAW: User Created") } else { FIRAuth.auth()?.createUser(withEmail: email, password: password, completion: { (user, error ) in if error != nil { print ("DAW: User failed to authenticate with Firebase") } else { print ("DAW: Successfully") if let user = user { self.completeSignIn(id: user.uid) } } }) } }) } }
@IBAction func loginRegisterBtnPressed(_ sender: AnyObject) { if let email = emailTextField.text, let password = passwordTextField.text { if email != "" && password != ""{ FIRAuth.auth()?.signIn(withEmail: email, password: password, completion: { (user, error ) in if error == nil { performSegue(withIdentifier: "profileVC", sender: self) } else { FIRAuth.auth()?.createUser(withEmail: email, password: password, completion: { (user, error ) in if error != nil { print ("DAW: User failed to authenticate with Firebase") } else { print ("DAW: Successfully") if let user = user { self.completeSignIn(id: user.uid) } } }) } }) } } }
