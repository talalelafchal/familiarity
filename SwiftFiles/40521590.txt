Is it possible to block execution of my code until UIAlertController is dismissed?
is there anyway to wait the user to press the button that dismiss the alertController in swift 3, by using DispatchQueue or something else?
You mean something like this? alertController.displayAndWaitUntilDismissed() // This line is only reached after the alert controller is dismissed print("Alert controller dismissed.") Theoretically, yes, you could use a dispatch semaphore to block until the alert is dismissed. But it’s a bad idea – I can’t even think of a scenario where it would be acceptable. Simply accept that you have to deal with it asynchronously, by executing the desired code in the alert controller action.
Just move all the code you want to execute after the alert is dismissed into a separate method. When you're adding UIAlertActions, make all the actions' handler parameter call that method. This way, whichever button the user presses, your code will always be executed!
