UIImagePickerController - How do I access the front facing camera by default?
<p>I am bringing up the camera with the following code from my ViewController:</p> <pre><code>- (void)viewDidLoad { self.imgPicker = [[UIImagePickerController alloc] init]; self.imgPicker.sourceType = UIImagePickerControllerCameraDeviceFront; self.imgPicker.delegate = self; } - (IBAction)grabCamera { [self presentModalViewController:self.imgPicker animated:YES]; } </code></pre> <p>How can I make it so the camera by default uses the front camera of the iPhone4 and not the back camera? I tried DeviceFront to no avail.</p> <p><strike>Also, How can I add a subview (half sized) ontop of this camera after grabCamera is pressed? If I have this subview in my MainWindow.xib I tried just saying addSubview after saying the presentModalViewController code but it didn't work... Do I need to create an NSTimer and load the addSubview after the camera display is fully presented or do I need to use something else (similar to z-index in CSS) </strike> The answer to the second question is imgPicker.cameraOverlayView = viewName;</p> <p>Thanks all!</p>
<p><code>UIImagePickerControllerCameraDeviceFront</code> is not a valid enum for the <code>sourceType</code> property. The <code>sourceType</code> property defines whether you're using the camera or the photo library. You need to set the <code>cameraDevice</code> property instead.</p> <h2>Objective-C</h2> <pre><code>self.imgPicker.sourceType = UIImagePickerControllerSourceTypeCamera; self.imgPicker.cameraDevice = UIImagePickerControllerCameraDeviceFront; </code></pre> <h2>Swift 2</h2> <pre><code>imgPicker.sourceType = .Camera imgPicker.cameraDevice = .Front </code></pre> <h2>Swift 3</h2> <pre><code>imgPicker.sourceType = .camera imgPicker.cameraDevice = .front </code></pre>
