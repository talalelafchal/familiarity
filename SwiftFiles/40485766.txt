Swift: Autoplay and auto fullScreen for youtube video
I have to embed youtube videos in my swift application. The video have to be played automatically after a button click and in the fullScreen mode. I have searched a lot and I have found that many ways exists to embed youtube videos but not all of them support the autoplay and the auto fullScreen. I have tested this code but the video is not autoplayed and itâ€™s not automatically showed in fullScreen mode:  let webView:UIWebView = UIWebView(frame: CGRect(x: 0, y: 0, width: UIScreen.main.bounds.width, height: UIScreen.main.bounds.height)) self.view.addSubview(webView) webView.allowsInlineMediaPlayback = true let myVideo = "https://www.youtube.com/embed/N-GNV7jhKV4" let myHTML = "<iframe width=\"\(webView.frame.size.width)\" height=\"\(webView.frame.size.height)\" src=\"\(myVideo)?autoplay=1\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=1></iframe>" webView.loadHTMLString(myHTML, baseURL: nil) webView.mediaPlaybackRequiresUserAction = false Can someone please tell me what is the best way to satisfy all the conditions cited above (autoplay and auto full screen) between my code, the YouTube-Player-iOS-Helper and Swift-YouTube-Player or if someone have other suggestions.
