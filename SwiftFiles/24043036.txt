could not find an overload for '+' that accepts the supplied arguments
<p>So I am trying to convert a game I was making in Objective-C to Swift.</p> <p>I am trying to get this to work, but it keeps giving me an error.</p> <pre><code> var actualX = (Double(arc4random() ) % Double(rangeX) ) + Double(minX); </code></pre> <p>I have also tried:</p> <pre><code> var actualX = (arc4random() % rangeX) + minX; </code></pre> <p>I have looked at the other posts on Stack Overflow of similar problems, but none of them have helped or solved my problem... </p>
<p><code>arc4random()</code> returns a <code>UInt32</code>, any argument to your <code>%</code> operator has to be a compatible type.</p> <p>Co-erce your variables to a <code>UInt32</code>. You don't mention what type they are, but I am assuming they are some form of integer. You can obviously coerce to another type later.</p> <pre><code>var actualX = (arc4random() % UInt32(rangeX)) + UInt32(minX) </code></pre> <p>This is a result of the strong typing in swift.</p>
<p>This works fine for me:</p> <pre><code>import Cocoa let minX = 3.2 let rangeX = 42.0 let actualX = (Double(arc4random()) % rangeX) + minX </code></pre> <p>After execution actualX will be a Double because of type inference of Swift.</p> <p>@otherRepliants: Of course arc4random() returns an UInt32, but why not cast it to Double. Works fine.</p>
