Variable names at the end
<p>I am going through the new Apple Swift language.</p> <p>Why should I use variable name at the end ?</p> <pre><code>var largest = 0 for (kind, numbers) in interestingNumbers { for number in numbers { if number &gt; largest { largest = number } } } largest </code></pre>
<p>Are you asking why the last line is <code>largest</code>? Paste the code into a playground and you'll see it show the value of largest on the right at that line. It's just so you can see what the value is after the loop.</p>
<p>If you are following the learning book (I see the code sample taken from the iBook) without Xcode; you are missing Xcode's Playground.</p> <p>Download Xcode 6 Beta, open playground, paste above code, see the magic ;-)</p> <p><strong>Playground</strong> is a tool to see what happens in your code as you type.</p> <p>Also to understand the philosophy behind Xcode Playground take a look at this video:</p> <p>Bret Victor - Inventing on Principle <a href="http://vimeo.com/36579366" rel="nofollow">http://vimeo.com/36579366</a></p>
