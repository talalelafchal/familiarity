Firebase keepSynced multiple child's
Is it possible to use keepSynced on the top key and then get child's while offline? My data base structure is the following: post -all -type1 -type2 -type3 then i have this let newsRef = FIRDatabase.database().reference(withPath: "post") newsRef.keepSynced(true) But when i query (offline) inside allI get no data. And adding a keepSynced for all types does not seem as a good approach. The only way i was able to make it work was with this let newsRef1 = FIRDatabase.database().reference(withPath: "post/all") newsRef1.keepSynced(true) let newsRef2 = FIRDatabase.database().reference(withPath: "post/type1") newsRef2.keepSynced(true)
