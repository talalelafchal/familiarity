Prepare For Segue Swift
I am creating a map app and I have created a segue from the "info" button to below UI; However now I am unsure how to setup the prepare for segue as I want: The image to be imported which is not featured on the first view The Title to be imported which is on the first view The Description to be imported which is not on the first view I was going to use this: override func prepare(for segue: UIStoryboardSegue, sender: Any?) { } but I am unsure how to make it unique for all 20 pins. Is this possible? Or do I need the image & description on the first view. Any Help is appreciated.
