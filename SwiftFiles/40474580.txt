Getting keyboard height before it appears
I want to get the keyboard height of the device to build some objects at the same height. These objects will be there before the keyboard actually appears so I can't use a method like this. I was wondering if there's a way to get the height of the keyboard without it actually appearing?
Iv also had a similar issue. I havent found a way to get the keyboard height without the keyboard showing up first, but I do have a way around it. var keyboardHeight = CGFloat() var keyboardFirstTime = true in view did load  NotificationCenter.default.addObserver(self, selector: #selector(keyboardWillShow), name: NSNotification.Name.UIKeyboardWillShow, object: nil) separate function that gives keyboard height func keyboardWillShow(_ notification:Notification) { let userInfo:NSDictionary = (notification as NSNotification).userInfo! as NSDictionary let keyboardFrame:NSValue = userInfo.value(forKey: UIKeyboardFrameEndUserInfoKey) as! NSValue let keyboardRectangle = keyboardFrame.cgRectValue keyboardHeight = keyboardRectangle.height } in textFieldDidBeginEditing func textFieldDidBeginEditing(_ textField: UITextField) { //adds .01 delay to wait and assign keyboard height for the first time if keyboardFirstTime == true { let when = DispatchTime.now() + 0.01 DispatchQueue.main.asyncAfter(deadline: when) { UIView.animate(withDuration: 0.25, delay: 0, options: [.curveEaseOut], animations: { self.searchField.frame.origin.y = self.view.frame.height - self.keyboardHeight - self.searchField.frame.size.height }, completion: nil) } keyboardFirstTime = false } else { UIView.animate(withDuration: 0.3, delay: 0, options: [.curveEaseOut], animations: { self.searchField.frame.origin.y = self.view.frame.height - self.keyboardHeight - self.searchField.frame.size.height }, completion: nil) } textField.text = "" }
