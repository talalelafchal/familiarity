Swift: How to draw UIs in Playground?
<p>How to draw UIs (Rectangle, Buttons, Views, etc) and view the results in real-time, as shown here: <a href="https://devimages.apple.com.edgekey.net/swift/images/swift-screenshot.jpg">https://devimages.apple.com.edgekey.net/swift/images/swift-screenshot.jpg</a> ? All I can see is the Console Output, but I can't find the option to show the visual display (Balloons) and the chart.</p>
<p>Charts appear in the Assistant editor when you have something like a <code>for</code> loop, or for anything where you press the quick look or circle/plus buttons when mousing over the results area.
