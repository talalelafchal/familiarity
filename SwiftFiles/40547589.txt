Copy object on swift
I have an array of Client object called ClientsArr. I want to create a new array, put on it few Client objects from ClientArr and change their properties without affecting ClientArr. var newArrCleints = [Client]() newArrCleints.append(ClientsArr[3]) newArrCleints[0].age = 23 This code will also change the age of the third Client in ClientsArr. I also tried this code newArrCleints.append(ClientsArr[3].copy() as! Client) but I got an error terminating with uncaught exception of type NSException I also tried to copy the hole array with this code var newArrCleints = ClientsArr.map{$0.copy()} And I got the same error. Client is a class and for some reasons I can't/don't want to change it to a structure.
