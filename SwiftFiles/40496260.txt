Segmented Control in Xib not able to change options
I have created a XIB for segmented control. When i am trying to assign the values to the segmented control it is not taking it.By default it has 2 default values first and second. They are not getting replaced with the new list that i am assigning. Please find my code below.  var segmControl = Bundle.main.loadNibNamed("SegmentedControl", owner: self, options: nil)?.first as! SegmentedControl; segmControl.segControl(items: items) // This line gives error that [![Error][1]][1] I tried the following approach too. Created a new instance of UISegmentedControl with items and assigned it to the XIB instance of Segmented control still it is not showing the below items in the segmented items.  var customSC = UISegmentedControl(items: ["One","Two","Three"]) customSC.selectedSegmentIndex = 0 // Set up Frame and SegmentedControl customSC.frame = CGRect(x: frame.minX + 10, y: frame.minY + 50, width: frame.width - 20, height: 30) // Style the Segmented Control customSC.layer.cornerRadius = 5.0 customSC.backgroundColor = UIColor.brown customSC.tintColor = UIColor.white customSC.tag = indexPath.row segmControl.segControl = customSC Please suggest. Thank you in advance.
