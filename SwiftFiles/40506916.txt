How to get class properties label in swift 3?
I want to get class properties label in runtime. for example, I have this class:  class BasicD { public var id_: Int64 = 0 public var a: Int32 = 0 public var c: NSData? public var d: NSData? } I need to output to be: [id_,a,c,d] I want somthing like reflection in java. I know mirror do like reflection, but for geting class properties in mirror I should initialize class first, but I do not want to do that.
You can use Mirror in swift3 to get all the properties of a class like this class BasicD{ public var id_: Int64 = 0 public var a: Int32 = 0 public var c: NSData? public var d: NSData? } let obj = BasicD() var arrayOfObjects: [String] = [] let mirror = Mirror(reflecting: obj) for child in mirror.children { guard let key = child.label else { continue } arrayOfObjects.append(key) print(key) } print(arrayOfObjects) Here arrayOfObjects contains all your variable name of class BasicD
