Swift Compiler is attempting to compile ObjC
<p>I've been digging into Swift since last night and I've encountered something strange. I have included a few ObjC classes in my Swift project -- making use of the Bridging Header. However, when I attempt to build the project, the Swift compiler complains because, by all appearances, it is attempting to compile the ObjC code. Is there a step I'm missing here? Has anyone else encountered this problem and found a solution?</p> <p>I have scoured the docs, to no avail.</p>
<p>It turns out this was a silly oversight on my part. Many third-party ObjC libraries/code <strong>do not</strong> include Foundation -- assuming it would already be present. Of course, in Swift, this is not the case.</p> <p>Once I added <code>#import &lt;Foundation/Foundation.h&gt;</code> to my imported header, all was well.</p>
