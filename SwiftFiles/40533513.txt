UIStackView without distribution or filling
I have a view on my app where I need to be able to push a dynamic number of custom subviews (the number of views changes whilst its running). My original idea was a tableview, but it seems a bit OTT setting up all the delegate methods. Then i found UIStackView, which is great as it handles redrawing and resizing when I add and remove the subviews. However when I have a small number of views in the UIStackView. It will either make each view bigger vertically to fill the space, or distribute them across the stackview depending on the various settings. What i'd like to have is each view I add just be appended under any existing views in the stack. I don't want distribution or filling of the blank space in the stack. Kind of like a UIStackView with each subview having a height constraint. I assume this isn't possible with a stackview, so how else can this be achieved? Do I have to use the tableview after all (or fallback to laying it out in code?)
If your views have a defined height constraint, this should work with the Distribution being Equal Spacing.
