Debug iOS App Share Extension with Contacts
I am just starting out with iOS App Share Extension and dutifully followed the instructions for Xcode 8.1 to create a new target. Great, it gave me some simple boilerplate code and a scheme. I then put some breakpoints on the code view that was generated and tried to run the extension target. It asks me for an app. Hm, I didn't see Contacts, so chose my app instead. My app appears in the simulator. I close (home) my app and start Contacts. I go to share a contact and my extension shows!!! I tap it and a generic dialog appears. But nothing shows up in my debugger or in my log from print. What switch am I missing?
