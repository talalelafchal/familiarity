In the storyboard the width of the UIViewController is not the width of the iPhone
<p>I am trying out the new Xcode6. When I create a new project for an iPhone and I open up the storyboard, the default UIViewController is wider than the iPhone width.</p> <p>Why is that so?</p>
<p>That's due to a new feature in Interface Builder, that enables designing for multiple device sizes and orientations in a single Storyboard. From the docs:</p> <blockquote> <p>Size classes for iOS 8 make dealing with different screen sizes and orientations more flexible. You can create a single interface that works on both iPad and iPhone, automatically adjusting to orientation change as well. Use size classes to design a single, universal storyboard, with small customizations, which adjusts to the strengths of each form factor. There is no longer any need to create an device-specific storyboardâ€”instead, you target the appropriate size classes and tune your interface for the best experience on each device. iOS Simulator fully supports size classes as well.</p> </blockquote> <p>When working with size classes, ViewControllers are represented with square views by default, in order to make clear that you aren't laying out the views in a specific orientation or interface size.</p> <p>You can disable Size Classes on a per storyboard basis. Just uncheck the Use Size Classes option:</p> <p><img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/GkU41.png" alt="Disabling Size Classes"></p> <p>For more detail on Size Classes, refer to the <a href="https://developer.apple.com/library/prerelease/ios/recipes/xcode_help-IB_adaptive_sizes/AboutAdaptiveSizeDesign.html#//apple_ref/doc/uid/TP40014436-CH6-SW1" rel="nofollow noreferrer">Apple Docs</a></p>
