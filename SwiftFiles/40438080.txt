Swift - init in singleton class?
I have a singleton class MyClass for management work with third party sdk. Inside singleton I have init method. My question is : does init method called every time I call something from singleton like MyClass.shared.mymethod() or in order to call init I have to call var instance = MyClass() ?
The init gets called only the first time you invoke MyClass.shared At that point the instance of MyClass is saved inside the shared static constant. Example Let's consider this Singleton class final class Singleton { static let shared = Singleton() private init() { print("Singleton initialized") } var count = 0 } Now let's look at the output into the console As you can see the Singleton initialized string is printed only once. This means the init is only called once. Note: Of course I assumed the implementation of your Singleton class is correct.
