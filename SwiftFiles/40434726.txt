touch and dragging a label
I'm making a drag and drop matching game. I have many labels that can be dragged but I can't seem to make a selected label be draggable, here's my code so far var touchedLabel: SKLabelNode! var labels: [SKLabelNode] = [] override func touchesMoved(_ touches: Set<UITouch>, with event: UIEvent?) { for touch in touches { //detect where the touch is happening touchLocation = touch.location(in: self) //check array which label was selected and assign it to variable for label in labels { if label.contains(touchLocation) { touchedLabel = label } //move the label to the dragged location touchedLabel.position.x = touchLocation.x touchedLabel.position.y = touchLocation.y } } it runs fine but seems to crash at "touchedLabel.position.x = touchLocation.x"
