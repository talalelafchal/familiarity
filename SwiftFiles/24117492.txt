Make my Swift Class
<p>I implemented a Table in Swift that looks like the PassBook app and i would like to make a class and put it on GitHub so who need something like that can easily use it as a UITableView. Does someone know how to make a class in Swift?</p>
<blockquote> <p>“Use <strong>class</strong> followed by the class’s name to create a class. A property declaration in a class is written the same way as a constant or variable declaration, except that it is in the context of a class. Likewise, method and function declarations are written the same way.</p> </blockquote> <pre><code>class Shape { var numberOfSides = 0 func simpleDescription() -&gt; String { return "A shape with \(numberOfSides) sides." } } </code></pre> <p><a href="https://itunes.apple.com/in/book/swift-programming-language/id881256329?mt=11" rel="nofollow">For more, read “The Swift Programming Language.” iBooks.</a></p>
