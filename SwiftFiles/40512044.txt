Cocoa pods error with Google maps
I download a git repositorie. It uses google maps. When I compiled the project, the project shows 160 errors. I already try to update, change version of maps, install, gem update Maybe its a problem with the podfile. Podfile:  # Uncomment the next line to define a global platform for your project source 'https://github.com/CocoaPods/Specs.git' platform :ios, '9.0' target 'FamilyNexus' do # Comment the next line if you're not using Swift and don't want to use dynamic frameworks use_frameworks! # Pods for Myapp pod 'Firebase/Core' pod 'Firebase/Database' pod 'GoogleMaps' pod 'GooglePlaces' pod 'SideMenu' pod 'Alamofire' pod 'AlecrimCoreData', :git => 'https://github.com/Alecrim/AlecrimCoreData.git', :branch => 'develop' target 'MyappTests' do inherit! :search_paths # Pods for testing pod 'GoogleMaps' pod 'Alamofire' end target 'MyappUITests' do inherit! :search_paths # Pods for testing pod 'GoogleMaps' pod 'Alamofire' end end
Was a error with version. I downgrade version of google maps pod to pod 'GoogleMaps', '2.1.0'
