Objective C to Swift translator?
<p>I literally need to translate one line of code from Objective C to Swift, any takers? This is a line from the tutorial in the link below.</p> <pre><code>- (IBAction)unwindToList:(UIStoryboardSegue *)segue; </code></pre> <p><a href="https://developer.apple.com/library/prerelease/ios/referencelibrary/GettingStarted/RoadMapiOS/SecondTutorial.html#//apple_ref/doc/uid/TP40011343-CH8-SW1" rel="nofollow">https://developer.apple.com/library/prerelease/ios/referencelibrary/GettingStarted/RoadMapiOS/SecondTutorial.html#//apple_ref/doc/uid/TP40011343-CH8-SW1</a></p> <p>Also if there was a reference book/website that could do so, that would be amazing</p>
<p>That's an Objective-C method interface declaration, which Swift doesn't have or need. You'd just use the implementation of the method:</p> <pre><code>@IBAction func unwindToList(segue: UIStoryboardSegue) { // do something } </code></pre>
