AKSwiftSlideMenu memory usage stacking of view controllers
I am using a slide menu aka AKSwiftSlideMenu My simple question is which one of the following methods used to transfer to a second controller is best? I am concerned that one of more of the methods below will consume memory or does using the sidemenu unload the vc. I used the slide to get to vc1 where I have a button that gets to vc2 from vc1 ... so it home->vc1->vc2 self.openViewControllerBasedOnIdentifier("secondViewController") present(secondViewController, animated: false, completion: nil) self.navigationController!.pushViewController(secondViewController, animated: true) or does func viewDidDisappear mean the vc is gone?
