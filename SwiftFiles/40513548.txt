Add Annotations in MapKit - Programmatically
I am trying to add annotations to my map. I have an array of points with coordinates inside. I am trying to add annotations from those coordinates. I have this defined: var points: [CLLocationCoordinate2D] = [CLLocationCoordinate2D]() let annotation = MKPointAnnotation() points has coordinates inside. I checked. And I do this: for index in 0...points.count-1 { annotation.coordinate = points[index] annotation.title = "Point \(index+1)" map.addAnnotation(annotation) } It keeps adding only the last annotation... Instead of all of them. Why is this? By the way, is there a way to delete a specified annotation, by title for example?
Each annotation needs to be a new instance, you are using only one instance and overriding its coordinates. So change your code: for index in 0...points.count-1 { let annotation = MKPointAnnotation() // <-- new instance here annotation.coordinate = points[index] annotation.title = "Point \(index+1)" map.addAnnotation(annotation) }
You can edit your for loop with the below code I think your array would be like points array  let points = [ ["title": "New York, NY", "latitude": 40.713054, "longitude": -74.007228], ["title": "Los Angeles, CA", "latitude": 34.052238, "longitude": -118.243344], ["title": "Chicago, IL", "latitude": 41.883229, "longitude": -87.632398] ] for point in points { let annotation = MKPointAnnotation() annotation.title = point["title"] as? String annotation.coordinate = CLLocationCoordinate2D(latitude: point["latitude"] as! Double, longitude: point["longitude"] as! Double) mapView.addAnnotation(annotation) } it's working for me. All the best for you.
