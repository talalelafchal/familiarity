How to disable horizontal scrolling of UIScrollView?
<p>I have a <code>UIView</code> like iPhone's Springboard. I have created it using a <code>UIScrollView</code> and <code>UIButtons</code>. I want to disable horizontal scrolling on said scrollview. I want only vertical scrolling. How do i accomplish this?</p>
<p>You have to set the <code>contentSize</code> property of the <code>UIScrollView</code>. For example, if your <code>UIScrollView</code> is 320 pixels wide (the width of the screen), then you could do this:</p> <pre><code>CGSize scrollableSize = CGSizeMake(320, myScrollableHeight); [myScrollView setContentSize:scrollableSize]; </code></pre> <p>The <code>UIScrollView</code> will then only scroll vertically, because it can already display everything horizontally.</p>
<p><strong>UPDATED:</strong> (After @EranMarom pointed out on his comment)</p> <p>You can <strong>stop horizontal scrolling or vertical scrolling</strong> in the <code>ScrollViewDelegate</code> Method. Here it is how,</p> <p><strong>Stops Horizontal Scrolling:</strong></p> <p>If you want to scroll horizontally, then you need to increase the contentOffset.x. Preventing that stops the scrollview scroll in horizontal direction.</p> <pre><code>- (void)scrollViewDidScroll:(UIScrollView *)sender { sender.contentOffset.x = 0.0 } </code></pre> <p><strong>Stops Vertical Scrolling:</strong></p> <p>If you want to scroll vertically, then you need to increase the contentOffset.y. Preventing that stops the scrollview scroll in vertical direction.</p> <pre><code>- (void)scrollViewDidScroll:(UIScrollView *)sender { sender.contentOffset.y = 0.0 } </code></pre> <p>Above code prevents the changes in <code>x</code> and <code>y</code> of a <code>scrollview contentOffset</code> and it leads to stop the scrolling in <code>scrollViewDidScroll:</code> method.</p>
<p>since iOS7 use </p> <pre><code>self.automaticallyAdjustsScrollViewInsets = NO; </code></pre> <p>//and create you page scroller with 3 pages</p> <pre><code> self.pageView = [[UIScrollView alloc] initWithFrame:CGRectMake(0, 0, self.view.frame.size.width, self.view.frame.size.height)]; [self.pageView setContentSize:CGSizeMake(self.view.frame.size.width*3, self.view.frame.size.height)]; [self.pageView setShowsVerticalScrollIndicator:NO]; [self.pageView setPagingEnabled:YES]; [self.view addSubview:self.pageView]; </code></pre>
<p>Once I did it replacing the UIScrollView with a UITableView with only 1 cell, it worked fine.</p>
<p>I struggled with this for some time trying unsuccessfully the various suggestions in this and other threads. However, in another thread (not sure where) someone suggested that using a negative constraint on the UIScrollView worked for him. So I tried various combinations of constraints with inconsistent results. What eventually worked for me was to add leading and trailing constraints of -32 to the scrollview and add an (invisible) textview with a width of 320 (and centered).</p>
<blockquote> <p><strong>Swift solution</strong></p> </blockquote> <p>Create two outlets, one for your view and one for your scroll view:</p> <pre><code>@IBOutlet weak var myView: UIView! @IBOutlet weak var scrollView: UIScrollView! </code></pre> <p>Then in your viewDidLayoutSubviews you can add the following code:</p> <pre><code>let scrollSize = CGSizeMake(myView.frame.width, myView.frame.height) scrollView.contentSize = scrollSize </code></pre> <p>What we've done is collected the height and width of the view and set the scrollViews content size to match it. This will stop your scrollview from scrolling horizontally. </p> <hr> <p><strong>More Thoughts:</strong></p> <p>CGSizeMake takes a width &amp; height using CGFloats. You may need to use your UIScrollViews existing height for the second parameter. Which would look like this:</p> <pre><code>let scrollSize = CGSizeMake(myView.frame.width, scrollView.contentSize.height) </code></pre>
<p>You can select the view, then under <code>Attributes Inspector</code> uncheck <code>User Interaction Enabled</code> .</p>
