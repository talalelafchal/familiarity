Extra junk value when converting float into string
<p>I was playing with the floats and explicit conversion of the floats into desired types. What I'm getting is when you convert a float into string, there is some junk data that comes along. Why is that happening ?</p> <p>Heres my code : </p> <pre><code>let a:Float = 5.23 var fName = "john" var lName = "doe" var fullName = fName + lName var mixedString = fullName + String(a) print(mixedString) </code></pre> <p>This gives <code>johndoe5.23000001907349</code> as output. What is going on here with the extra <code>1907349</code></p>
<p>The <code>Float</code> type isn't terribly precise, so you're getting a little extra garbage from the imprecision. If you omit the <code>Float</code> type declaration, you'll get a <code>Double</code> instead, which won't have this problem.</p> <pre><code>let a = 5.23 var fName = "john" var lName = "doe" var fullName = fName + lName var mixedString = fullName + String(a) print(mixedString) // prints "johndoe5.23" </code></pre>
