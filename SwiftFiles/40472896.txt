String.replaceOccurrences(of:with:) not working?
Simple problem, tricky solution: I have a string which includes spaces and I want to get rid of them but calling replaceOccurrences(of:with:) doesn't do anything. let originalString:String = "+005 78 34 56" let stringWithoutSpaces:String = originalString.replacingOccurrences(of: " ", with: "") print(stringWithoutSpaces) stringWithoutSpaces is exactly the same as originalString. Could this be an Xcode bug or am I overlooking something? UPDATE: A screenshot of the code in my project. And a screenshot of the debug log to verify the original string contained spaces:
I changed the : to =. That should fix it. let str = "Hello, playground" let withoutSpaces = str.replacingOccurrences(of: " ", with: "") // result: "Hello,playground" If you are not getting the desired result you should check if the value is correctly read from the correct variable the value is correctly displayed the value is not changed back before being displayed the input value is what you expect
