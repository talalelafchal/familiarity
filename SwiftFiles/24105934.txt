How to create multidimensional array in swift?
<p>I'm trying to push array type object to special index inside array in new Swift lang by Apple. It should look like this = <code>[ [...], [...], ...]</code>, as I've read in the docs - <code>NSMutableArray</code> type is assigned to variable automatically if it's <code>var</code>, but even in playground it throws me errors:</p> <pre><code>var arr = []; arr[0] = []; // Error: cannot assign to result of this expression arr.insert([], atIndex:0) // Error: 'NSArray' does not have member named 'insert' </code></pre>
<pre><code>var array2d: [[Int]] = [[1,2,3,4],[5,6,7,8]] </code></pre>
