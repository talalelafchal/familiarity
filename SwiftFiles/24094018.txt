Unable to create array of SKActions
<p>I'm experimenting with SpriteKit in Swift but somehow seem unable to create an array of actions to use in a sequence. I've split it up to try and pin-point the problem, but no luck so far. </p> <pre><code>func animateBackground(){ let moveLeft = SKAction.moveByX(100, y: 0, duration: 3) moveLeft.timingMode = SKActionTimingMode.EaseInEaseOut let moveRight = SKAction.reversedAction(moveLeft) let actions = [moveLeft, moveRight] // &lt;--- here there be dragons/trouble let sequence = SKAction.sequence(actions) let repeat = SKAction.repeatActionForever(sequence) } </code></pre> <p>When trying to create the actions-array I get the error <em>"Cannot convert the expression's type 'Array' to type 'ArrayLiteralConvertible' "</em> So, I thought I might need to be more explicit and attempted to change it to</p> <pre><code>var actions: SKAction[] = [moveLeft, moveRight] </code></pre> <p>This seemed to bring down the house, and not in a good way, resulting in the <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/24063055/error-xcode-6-error-sourcekit-terminated-editor-functionality-temporaly-lim">SourceKit terminated</a> bug...</p>
<p>You're adding a function to the array for moveRight, not the SKAction itself. Try using this instead:</p> <pre><code>let moveRight = SKAction.reversedAction(moveLeft)() </code></pre>
<p>When you create moveRight you're actually generating a function. You can call the function with "()" to get the actual SKAction. I added explicit types to the two SKAction's so it's clear that they can be put in an SKAction[]:</p> <pre><code>let moveLeft:SKAction = SKAction.moveByX(100, y: 0, duration: 3) moveLeft.timingMode = SKActionTimingMode.EaseInEaseOut let moveRight:SKAction = moveLeft.reversedAction() let actions = [moveLeft, moveRight] let sequence = SKAction.sequence(actions) let repeat = SKAction.repeatActionForever(sequence) </code></pre>
