Problems with current location pin
<p>I'm working on an app that shows a couple of places on the map along with the user's current position. I have two small problems with it:</p> <ul> <li>First off, I want the current location pin to be the default blue circle, but it shows a green pin just like the other locations.</li> <li>Second problem, whenever I touch the screen, the current location pin drops again. It just can't seem to be steady like the other ones. It's like it's being called whenever I interact with the app.</li> </ul>
<p>Make sure you set your mapView delegate to self...that should fix the pin color. Not sure about your other problem</p> <p>// in the viewDidLoad [mapView setDelegate:self];</p> <p>where "mapView" is defined as "IBOutlet MKMapView *mapView;"</p>
