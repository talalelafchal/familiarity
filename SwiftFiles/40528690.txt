didSelectItemAt indexPath called after a long press
I have used collectionview and set the imageview in collection view cell. i need to move another viewcontroller after the cell was touched. But my problem is the view moves after a long press on cell in collection view. This is my code. func collectionView(_ collectionView: UICollectionView, didSelectItemAt indexPath: IndexPath) { let imagesPath = documentPath.appendingPathComponent(reportImageFolder) let cell = arrImagesFiltered[indexPath.item] let imageNameWithPath = "\(imagesPath)/\(cell)" let imageEditViewController = self.storyboard?.instantiateViewController(withIdentifier: "EditImageViewController") as! EditImageViewController imageEditViewController.imagePath = imageNameWithPath self.navigationController?.pushViewController(imageEditViewController, animated: true) }
