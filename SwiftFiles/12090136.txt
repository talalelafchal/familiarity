Difference between Keychain and NSUserDefault?
<p>I am new to <code>objective C</code>, I have created one application in that I have used both <code>NSUserDefault</code> and <code>Keychain</code> to store my user name and password. But I cant differentiate both. Please help to differentiate the both.</p> <p>Thank you.</p>
<p>A <strong>keychain</strong> is an encrypted container that holds passwords for multiple applications and secure services. Apple Inc. uses keychains as password management system in Mac OS and iOS.</p> <p><strong>NSUserDefaults</strong> Provides a way for application behavior customization based on user preferences. Belongs to the Foundation framework for Cocoa and Cocoa Touch. </p> <p>I got this from Tag Information of <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/nsuserdefaults">NSUserdefaults</a> and <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/keychain">keychain</a> </p>
<p>Addition: When we saved userName and Password. and Remove app from device.</p> <p>In Keychain: UserName and Password still is there.</p> <p>In NSUserDefaults: UserName and Password also remove from device with your app.</p>
