executeFetchRequest doesn't return the NSManagedObject subclass
<p>This is for XCode 6 and Swift...</p> <p>I'm trying to make a fetch request to the managed object context but it's not returning the correct subclass.</p> <p>I have already set the subclass in the data model data modeler configuration to the name of my custom subclass and in the code, it is extending the NSManagedObject class.</p> <p>Any ideas?</p> <p><img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/T6mSi.png" alt="enter image description here"> <img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/K3EHI.png" alt="enter image description here"> <img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/xN9hh.png" alt="enter image description here"></p>
<p>Check to make sure that in the "Entity" inspector (right side of the screen, Utilities pane) when Task is selected in your Model that its Class field is properly filled in with "Task" (it's blank by default).</p>
<p>Just figured out the solution.</p> <p>I had to add the <code>@objc</code> attribute to allow the class to be compatible with Objective-C.</p> <p>Now the fetch request is returning a correct result of <code>Tasks[]</code></p> <pre><code>import Foundation import CoreData @objc(Task) // make compatible with objective-c class Task : NSManagedObject { @NSManaged var note: String! @NSManaged var completed: Bool } </code></pre> <p>Reference: <a href="https://developer.apple.com/library/prerelease/ios/documentation/swift/conceptual/buildingcocoaapps/interactingwithobjective-capis.html#//apple_ref/doc/uid/TP40014216-CH4-XID_36">https://developer.apple.com/library/prerelease/ios/documentation/swift/conceptual/buildingcocoaapps/interactingwithobjective-capis.html#//apple_ref/doc/uid/TP40014216-CH4-XID_36</a></p>
<p>Using <code>@objc(Task)</code> seems to be working but you could also just edit the data model data modeler configuration to the name <code>ToDoList.Task</code> instead of just <code>Task</code>. That will work too and avoid Class conflicts if <code>Task</code> is used anywhere else in the Objective-C code.</p>
