Delete item from core data
I have a fucntion that returns me some strings func getURLsToSend () { //create a fetch request, telling it about the entity let fetchRequest: NSFetchRequest<URLsToSend> = URLsToSend.fetchRequest() do { //Get results let searchResults = try getContext().fetch(fetchRequest) //You need to convert to NSManagedObject to use 'for' loops for urls in searchResults as [NSManagedObject] { //get the Key Value pairs (although there may be a better way to do that... print("\(urls.value(forKey: "url"))") //Process URL //Delete from Core Data } } catch { print("Error with request: \(error)") } } As you can see in the comments after I've found each string (it's a url) I need to be able to process it and then delete it. I'm OK processing what I have that's fine I just have no idea how to go about deleting object from core data can somebody shed some light for me?
Realised my mistake, I needed to do context = getContext() and then I was able to simply do context.delete(urls)
