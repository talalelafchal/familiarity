SourceKitService Terminated with no Xcode warning or errors
<p>I was spacing out while starting a new project to port one of my Obj-C/SpriteKit apps over to Swift and started to add a touch for loop within touchesMoved. My mistake, but the weird issue is that I get "SourceKitService Terminated" and Xcode completely bugs out.</p> <pre><code>override func touchesMoved(touches: NSSet!, withEvent event: UIEvent!) { for touch: AnyObject in touches { } } </code></pre> <p>Specifically, this happens the moment I begin to type "touches" in the for loop. Entering "for touch: AnyObject in" everything is still fine. As soon as I continue to type "touches"... SourceKitService Terminated.</p> <p>I get that this should be an error, but why is Xcode completely freaking out because of this?</p>
<p>You have a syntax error so the SourceKitService is throwing up. It worked for me when I did</p> <pre><code>override func touchesMoved(touches: NSSet!, withEvent event: UIEvent!) { for touch : AnyObject in touches.allObjects{ print(touch) } } </code></pre> <p>Not sure if this fixes your issue. Please be kind we're all swift newbs :)</p>
<p>I was having a problem with xcode 6 beta 6. I finally changed the iOS Deployment Target from 7.0 to 7.1 and my problem went away!</p>
