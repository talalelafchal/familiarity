Auto layout cell based on subview or custom cell height
In the image. Comments has a textview that has text overflown to below 3 cells . Ideally that should not happen. I have a tableview with custom cells as xib files and some custom cells are subviews. Please let me know how to add auto layout for this subviews or xib's. I read many posts they suggested.below code. But it doesn't work. In ViewDidLoad. self.tableView.rowHeight = UITableViewAutomaticDimension self.tableView.estimatedRowHeight = 50; Please suggest a solution. Thank you.
It will works, but you need to update the height everytime a new character is input, so in your cellForRow, add textview.delegate = self, and in the textViewDidChange, do tableView.beginUpdate() and tableView.endUpdate(), the cell height will update correctly
