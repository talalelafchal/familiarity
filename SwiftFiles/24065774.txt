Calling a Function with NULL as Parameter
<p>I am trying to load an image with the following Code, but I have no clue how to do this in Swift.</p> <p>The <a href="https://developer.apple.com/library/ios/documentation/GraphicsImaging/Reference/CGImage/Reference/reference.html#//apple_ref/c/func/CGImageCreateWithPNGDataProvider" rel="nofollow">CGImage Reference</a> says, that I should pass NULL as parameter, but since NULL is not part of the Swift-Language this is not possible. Do I have to use UnsafePointer and if so, how?</p> <pre><code>var img = CGImageCreateWithPNGDataProvider(CGDataProviderCreateWithFilename("/Resources/image.png"),**?**, true,kCGRenderingIntentDefault) </code></pre> <p>Thanks in advance. </p>
<p>You should be able to pass <code>nil</code> for a null value.</p>
