Check Odd &amp; Even numbers in Swift (iOS)
<p>I have an array of numbers typed Int. I want to loop through the numbers list to get Odd &amp; Even numbers in Swift programming language (iOS8). Modulus (%) operator is not working here neither the dividend (/) operator. I don't know how will calculate it?</p> <p>Thanks in advance.</p>

<pre><code>var myArray = [23, 54, 51, 98, 54, 23, 32]; for myInt: Int in myArray{ if myInt % 2 == 0 { println("\(myInt) is even number") } else { println("\(myInt) is odd number") } } </code></pre>
