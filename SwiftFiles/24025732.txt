The Swift Programming Language Book Chapter Section on Control Flow Experiment 3
<p>I am working through the first chapter of the book and can't figure out the experiment:</p> <blockquote> <p>Add another variable to keep track of which kind of number was the largest, as well as what that largest number was.</p> </blockquote> <p>This is the code from the book:</p> <pre><code>let interstingNumbers = [ "Prime": [2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, 17], "Fibonacci": [1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8], "Square": [1, 4, 9, 16, 25, 36], ] var largest = 0 for (kind, numbers) in interstingNumbers { for number in numbers { if number &gt; largest { largest = number } } } largest </code></pre>
<p>So basically you'd want to put <code>kind</code> somewhere at the same time as you put <code>number</code> into <code>largest</code>, e.g. into a variable called <code>largestKind</code>.</p>
<p>Like this:</p> <pre><code>let interstingNumbers = [ "Prime": [2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, 17], "Fibonacci": [1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8], "Square": [1, 4, 9, 16, 25, 36], ] var largest = 0 var largestKind = "" for (kind, numbers) in interstingNumbers { for number in numbers { if number &gt; largest { largest = number largestKind = kind } } } largest largestKind </code></pre>
<p>The question asked to keep track of the value and type not to just display the type of the final answer. I think this gets closer:</p> <pre><code>let interestingNumbers = [ "Prime": [2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13], "Fibonacci": [1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8], "Square": [1, 4, 9, 16, 25], ] var largest = 0 var largestType = [String]() var largestValues = [Int]() for (kind, numbers) in interestingNumbers { for number in numbers { if number &gt; largest { largest = number largestValues.append(largest) largestType.append(kind) } } } print(largest) print(largestType) print(largestValues) </code></pre> <p>And now with tuples:</p> <pre><code>let interestingNumbers = [ "Prime": [2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13], "Fibonacci": [1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8], "Square": [1, 4, 9, 16, 25], ] var largest = 0 var largestValues: [(type: String, value: Int)] = [] for (kind, numbers) in interestingNumbers { for number in numbers { if number &gt; largest { largest = number largestValues.append(type: kind, value: number) } } } print(largest) print(largestValues) </code></pre>
