Reconnect method to chromecast from ios device
After learning normal google cast fundamentals, I am able to cast media to chromecast using Google chromecast SDK 3.2.0 however if my apps closes and when it comes back to foreground again, then I want my device to be auto connected to last connected device, so I stored the sessionid and device id however, I dont know which method to use to reconnect. Saving procedure  func didConnectToCastApplication applicationMetadata: GCKApplicationMetadata!, sessionID: String!, launchedApplication: Bool) { self.mediaControlChannel = GCKMediaControlChannel() mediaControlChannel!.delegate = self deviceManager.add(mediaControlChannel!) mediaControlChannel!.requestStatus() //storing sessionId and deviceId into defaults let defaults = UserDefaults.standard defaults.set(sessionID, forKey: "lastCCSessionId") if let deviceId = self.selectedDevice?.deviceID { defaults.set(deviceId, forKey: "lastCCDeviceId") } defaults.synchronize() }
You should implement CastReceiverManager whereby the receiver application registers listener functions on the onSenderConnected and onSenderDisconnected properties. The receiver manager allows communication with the platform and is used to to send/receive system messages/events. Do not instantiate this class directly; instead, obtain a reference to the singleton instance by calling getInstance(). By calling isConnected , if True the app is connected to a cast device.
