iOS one signal &quot;AppDelegate.swift:13:8: No such module 'OneSignal'&quot;
I installed one signal module through cocapods for Xcode8 and I'm not able to import the module into my code . Im seeing the following error "AppDelegate.swift:13:8: No such module 'OneSignal". I used "use_frameworks" in the pod file and I also set my "Framework Search Paths" in the Build settings to point to the dir . I cleaned the project, deleted Derived Data folder but still no luck . I'm attaching a few screen shots that could better explain the problem . I've been stuck on this for quite a while now and any help is very much appriciated
