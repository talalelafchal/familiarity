Receiving response from a website using JSON if only that product exists
I am trying to send a JSON request to a particular site for a particular product and receive a response as yes if that product is available on that site. If the product is not available, it automatically pings for the 2nd request and continues for the 3rd time, if still the product is not found I receive a response that the product is not there. When I send the JSON request my app has a particular view controller's view appearing, like the page with loading symbol, that needs to keep continuing showing loading unless I get a yes request from the site and get displayed on a label in the new view. Or show no after the 3rd attempt. .. How do I go doing this ?
