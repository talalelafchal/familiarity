Dictionary value by key
<p>While trying to get a value from a <code>Dictionary</code>, Xcode is showing me the following error:</p> <blockquote> <p>Could not find an overload for 'subscript' that accepts the supplied arguments</p> </blockquote> <pre><code>class func fromDictionary(enterpriseDictionary:Dictionary&lt;String, AnyObject&gt;) -&gt; Enterprise { var enterprise:Enterprise = Enterprise() enterprise.id = enterpriseDictionary["id"] as Int (ERROR OCCURS HERE) enterprise.name = enterpriseDictionary["name"] as? String ( AND HERE ) return enterprise } </code></pre>
<p>I managed to resolve this question by replacing the "AnyObject" by "Any" as seen below:</p> <pre><code>class func fromDictionary(enterpriseDictionary:Dictionary&lt;String, Any&gt;) -&gt; Enterprise { var enterprise:Enterprise = Enterprise() enterprise.id = enterpriseDictionary["id"] as Int enterprise.name = enterpriseDictionary["name"] as? String return enterprise } </code></pre> <p>As @Andrey Tarantsov said:</p> <p>This occurs because AnyObject is for any class instance (you can also think of it as objects in Objective-C sense); String and Int are not classes.</p>
