Use of bridgeToObjectiveC() in swift
<p>What does <em><strong>bridgeToObjectiveC()</strong></em> will do in swift. It seems like converting a <code>Swift</code> object into <code>ObjectiveC</code> object. Is this same as type casting?</p> <p>For example i can convert a swift <code>String</code> into <code>NSString</code> like </p> <pre><code>var swingString:String = "test string" var correspondingNSString = swingString.bridgeToObjectiveC() // Using bridge var correspondingNSString = swingString as NSString // type casting </code></pre> <p>I want to know both are same or not?</p>
<p>My understanding is that <code>bridgeToObjectiveC()</code> is provided so that you don't necessarily need to know what the corresponding objective-c type is; the compiler decides what the appropriate type is. </p> <p>For example: if you have an array of <code>Any</code> objects can you call <code>bridgeToObjectiveC()</code> on each of them with <code>map</code> without worrying about whether there are String, Int, and Double values.</p> <p>Using the <code>as</code> keyword allows you to explicitly choose which type you want to cast the value as.</p>
