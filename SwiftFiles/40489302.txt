Get Audio Title from AVPlayer in Cocoa App (swift)
I am currently working on an Project where I want to play a WebRadio stream and show the current Title and maybe the Album Name and Cover-Art. I can already play the Stream but I are currently not able to fetch the Song Title from the AVPlayer that plays the Stream. IÂ´ve googled a few hours but nothing really worked for me (the most is Objective C) The App is an Mac App (Cocoa App) not an iOS App, so there is a difference in code :) The current Code is: import Cocoa import AVFoundation class ViewController: NSViewController { @IBOutlet weak var TitleLabel: NSTextField! @IBOutlet weak var AlbumInterpretLabel: NSTextField! var _currentStream = NSURL(string: "http://mp3.ffh.de/radioffh/hqlivestream.mp3") //some German Radio stream which I use for Testing. var AudioPlayer = AVPlayer() override func viewDidLoad() { super.viewDidLoad() // Do any additional setup after loading the view. AudioPlayer = AVPlayer(url: _currentStream as! URL) } @IBAction func PlayButton(_ sender: NSButton) { AudioPlayer.play() } } Some not relevant Code is removed here (Volume Control, Pause, ...) I hope that someone can help me soon :)
