iOS: ScrollView Paging too far
I've got a collectionView that I am resizing. After the resize, I swipe to get to the next cell and the paging goes too far. However, when I programmatically scrollToRow, the scrollview snaps perfectly. At first, I thought the constraints may be causing the issue. Now I have a feeling that after I apply the transformation to the collectionview, either the scrollView or the flowLayout isn't registering the change in size. Is there a better way to resize a collectionView or a way to register the transformation with the scrollView? Resize Code: self.slideCollectionViewTopConstraint.constant = 80 self.slideCollectionViewLeftConstraint.constant = 150 self.slidesCollectionView.transform = CGAffineTransform(scaleX: 1.35, y: 1.35)
After you update the contraints you should tell the view it needs to recalculate its layout with layoutIfNeeded. Also can't you just update the width and height constraints instead of using a scale matrix? Per the documentation the transform doesn't affect autolayout, just the appearance.
