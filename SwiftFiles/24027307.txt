Could not find an overload for 'logInWithPermissions' that accepts the supplied arguments
<p>I'm receiving this error message in response to the following code. I understand this typically arises when a type needs to be explicitly converted, but the permissions array here is explicitly defined as an <code>AnyObject[]?</code>, the correct argument type. </p> <p>Edit: Using Facebook Login for Parse (documentation:<a href="https://www.parse.com/docs/ios_guide#fbusers-setup/iOS" rel="nofollow">https://www.parse.com/docs/ios_guide#fbusers-setup/iOS</a>)</p> <pre><code>let permissions: AnyObject[]? = ["email", "user_education_history", "publish_stream", "publish_actions"] PFFacebookUtils.logInWithPermissions(permissions, block: { (user: PFUser, error: NSError) in if (!user) { println("Uh oh. The user cancelled the Facebook login."); } else if (user.isNew) { println("User signed up and logged in through Facebook!"); } else { println("User logged in through Facebook!"); } }) } </code></pre>
<p>The problem is with the second argument, the block. The two arguments are typed as <code>PFUser</code> and <code>NSError</code>, but they should be optional types (because those values are coming from Objective-C and can be nil). You can fix it by excluding the types from your closure and letting the compiler infer them:</p> <pre><code>PFFacebookUtils.logInWithPermissions(permissions, block: { user, error in ... }) </code></pre>
