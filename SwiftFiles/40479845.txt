Different custom cache object is returned even if the same cache name is provided
I am working on an iOS app which uses Kingfisher library for caching images. During development I decided to create a custom cache other than the default cache provided by the Kingfisher. I created it with the following code let cache = ImageCache(name:"MYAPP") My assumption about the working of above code was if there was cache named "MYAPP" already exists, Kingfisher will retrieve the same cache otherwise it will create a new cache and return the cache object. But I was wrong. Every time I call the above code, cache object will be different. Is there any way to create an unique persistent custom cache in Kingfisher ? Thanks
