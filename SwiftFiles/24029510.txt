Parse Framework with Swift
<p>Has anyone tried using the Parse Framework with swift yet? As long as you add a bridge-file you can work with both swift and objective-c code. </p> <p>Here is my query.. the 'objects' array returned from Parse has all my data properly, but the method is returning before setting the 'results' array to the 'objects' array, so i keep getting nothing back from the function. Perhaps Parse will need to receive an update to support swift, or did I possibly make a mistake somewhere? Thanks</p> <pre><code> class func fetchAllCategories() -&gt; NSArray { var results : NSArray = NSArray() var query : PFQuery = PFQuery(className: "Category") query.findObjectsInBackgroundWithBlock({(NSArray objects, NSError error) in if (error != nil) { NSLog("error " + error.localizedDescription) } else { NSLog("objects %@", objects as NSArray) results = NSArray(array: objects) } }) NSLog("results %@", results) return results } </code></pre>
<p>This has nothing to do with Swift. <code>query.findObjectsInBackgroundWithBlock</code> does the work in the background so it's going to finish much later, after the function returns.</p>
