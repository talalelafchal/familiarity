Defining the file a UIImage will use (Swift)
<p>So I looked around the developer library on apple's site and I couldn't find any documentation that said how to state what file (like a png) to use for a UIImage using the swift language. So I try experimenting with this code:</p> <pre><code>class ViewController: UIViewController { @IBOutlet var maintitle: UIImageView var bigtitle: UIImage! var smalltitle: UIImage! override func viewDidLoad() { super.viewDidLoad() // Do any additional setup after loading the view, typically from a nib. func startAnimating(){ var animatedtitle: AnyObject[] = [bigtitle, smalltitle] var animationDuration: NSTimeInterval = 0.15 var animationRepeatCount: Int = 0 } } </code></pre> <p>What I was trying to do there was animate a never ending series of two images. I defined two UIImages (bigtitle &amp; small title) and was wondering how I define wat .png's to use for those UIImage's. I know this is a very basic and novice question but any help would be enjoyed.</p>
<p>Even though you are using Swift, all the classes that come from <code>UIKit</code> and other libraries still are written in Objective-C.</p> <p>There is no difference in the interfaces to these libraries, just the syntax.</p> <p>In this case, you need to use the object construction syntax:</p> <pre><code>var image = UIImage(named:"ImageName") </code></pre>
