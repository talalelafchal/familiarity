Cocoapods - Module Compiled with Swift 3.0 cannot be imported in Swift 3.0.1
Just updated to Xcode v8.1 and am trying to install a pod. However, once I import it, Xcode gives me an error saying Module Compiled with Swift 3.0 cannot be imported in Swift 3.0.1 and then a path to the module. I have tried saying Use Legacy Swift Language Version however this does not solve the issue. Any other ideas of what I can change to make this compile? I have a hard time believing a minor version change should cause this much trouble. Thanks in advance for any help.
This happens almost every update. Try pod update in the terminal where the pods are located to get all your pods to the latest versions.
