Can't make User Defined Runtime Attributes work
I would really like to be able to use the "User Defined Runtime Attributes " from xcode Storyboard to build a nice pop up through a container view. Unfortunately, I can't make it works and can't figure out why ! I found many topics (eg: Is it possible to set UIView border properties from interface builder?) which deal about it but this doesn't work for me... ! Here is the attribute inspector of the containerView embed UIView (I also tried to implement into containerView UIView too with no success). I added an extension to transform UIColor to CGColor as expected : extension CALayer { var borderUIColor: UIColor { set { self.borderColor = newValue.CGColor } get { return UIColor(CGColor: self.borderColor!) } } } Does someone could think about something missing ? Thank you very much in advance ;)
Instead of layer.borderColor, use layer.borderUIColor in your user defined runtime attributes. Just double click the key name and add UI.
