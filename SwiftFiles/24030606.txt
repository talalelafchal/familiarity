How to find out the max value for Int in Swift
<p>I want to understand how to access the "struct" type of Int. When I cmd-clicked Int it took me to this class, i want to find out what is the maximum value this can hold. Is there a way to pull from one of this properties ?. what is max and min in this structure ?</p> <pre><code>struct Int : SignedInteger { var value: Builtin.Word init() init(_ v: Builtin.Word) init(_ value: Int) static func convertFromIntegerLiteral(value: Int) -&gt; Int typealias ArrayBoundType = Int func getArrayBoundValue() -&gt; Int static var max: Int { get } static var min: Int { get } } </code></pre>
<blockquote> <p>“You can access the minimum and maximum values of each integer type with its min and max properties:</p> </blockquote> <pre><code>let minValue = UInt8.min // minValue is equal to 0, and is of type UInt8 let maxValue = UInt8.max // maxValue is equal to 255, and is of type UInt8 </code></pre> <blockquote> <p>The values of these properties are of the appropriate-sized number type (such as UInt8 in the example above) and can therefore be used in expressions alongside other values of the same type.”</p> </blockquote> <p>Excerpt From: Apple Inc. “The Swift Programming Language.” iBooks. <a href="https://itun.es/in/jEUH0">https://itun.es/in/jEUH0</a>.</p>

<p>You can access these as static properties as suggested in other answers.</p> <p>I see in some comments people are wondering why you can't access them as instance variables.</p> <p>This is like asking "what is the max value of 5?" and expecting a sensible answer.</p> <p>One of the main uses for these variables is guarding against <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Integer_overflow" rel="nofollow">integer overflows</a>.</p> <p>Something along the lines of "if I add something to this integer that makes it bigger than Int.max i.e. it triggers an overflow " and act accordingly.</p> <p>More on how Apple address the issue of integer overflows <a href="https://developer.apple.com/library/mac/documentation/Security/Conceptual/SecureCodingGuide/Articles/BufferOverflows.html#//apple_ref/doc/uid/TP40002577-SW7" rel="nofollow">here</a>.</p>
