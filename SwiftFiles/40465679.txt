I want func locationManager(manager: CLLocationManager, didUpdateToLocation to be called even after app is killed?
After my app is killed I want to relaunch the app based on the location.speed paramater, I mean to say when the device speed is>5kmph I want my app to get open and one button needs to be clicked programatically?
Set allowsBackgroundLocationUpdates = true The default value is NO for allowsBackgroundLocationUpdates If your app uses location in the background (without showing the blue status bar) you have to set allowsBackgroundLocationUpdates to YES in addition to setting the background mode capability in Info.plist. Otherwise location updates are only delivered in foreground. The advantage is that you can now have location managers with background location updates and other location managers with only foreground location updates in the same app. You can also reset the value to NO to change the behavior.
NOT POSSIBLE. You can not execute part of code when you process is killed. Its as simple as that. You can do this in android with background sevice which run even when you app gets killed because background service is different process. But iOS don't allow to create background service.
