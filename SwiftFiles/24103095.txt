How to use a Swift protocol in ObjC Framework
<p>I just started to add Swift in my ObjC framework project because it is quite new, solver directly the gap to CloudKit and therefore maybe interesting to migrate to code step-by-step to Swift.</p> <p>I tought i start with something simple, a protocol.</p> <p>I did the following: - I created a Swift file, and as you know there is no bridghing header for frameworks - added my protocol in this file</p> <p>and know i like to use it in my class's but well how? The solution for classes is simple, you just define a forward declaration. But was is about protocols?</p> <p>It seems at them moment this is the last element which i have to migrate or do you know a approach?</p> <p>Updated:</p> <p>What i forget to mentioned, i marked the protocol @objc, because in general it is possible to use a Swift protocol in ObjC but i just see at the moment restrictions in frameworks </p>
<p>Here's an example in my project name <code>SwiftProtocol</code>:</p> <p><strong>Renderable.swift</strong></p> <pre><code>@objc protocol Renderable { @objc func render() } </code></pre> <p><strong>Triangle.h</strong></p> <pre><code>#import "SwiftProtocol-Swift.h" // This is very important! @interface Triangle : NSObject &lt;Renderable&gt; @end </code></pre> <p><strong>Triangle.m</strong></p> <pre><code>@implementation Triangle - (void)render { // Do some rendering } @end </code></pre>
