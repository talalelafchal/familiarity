Check if app became active because of RemoteNotification ( App is already launched)
I want to differentiate if app becameActive in response to the RemoteNotification click. How to do that ?
you can check it like this  - (BOOL)application:(UIApplication *)application didFinishLaunchingWithOptions:(NSDictionary *)launchOptions { NSDictionary *notification = [launchOptions objectForKey:UIApplicationLaunchOptionsRemoteNotificationKey]; if (notification) { // it's launch from notification } else { // normal launch on app icon click } } for swift plz use this func application(_ application: UIApplication, didFinishLaunchingWithOptions launchOptions: [UIApplicationLaunchOptionsKey: Any]?) -> Bool { if (launchOptions?[UIApplicationLaunchOptionsKey.remoteNotification] as? NSDictionary) != nil { // it's launch from notification } else { // normal launch on app icon click } // Override point for customization after application launch. return true }
