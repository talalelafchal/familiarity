my view looks different on iphone 5 and iphone 6 even though it has constraints - what is wrong here?
In my swift app I am applying gradient to my view. I do it with the following code: @IBOutlet weak var gradientView: UIView! override func viewDidLoad(){ super.viewDidLoad() let layer = CAGradientLayer() layer.frame = CGRect(x: 0, y: 0, width: self.gradientView.frame.width, height: self.gradientView.frame.height) layer.colors = [UIColor.clear.cgColor, UIColor.white.cgColor] gradientView.layer.addSublayer(layer) } in my storyboard the gradientView is the black one here: its constraints are: so it touches edges on each side, the top and the white panel on the bottom. When I run it in iphone5 simulator I have: and that's fine. But when I run it on iphone 6s, I see: What's the problem here, since the constraints are applied?
The problem is that your gradientView's frame is not updated yet in viewDidLoad. Try this instead: let gradientLayer = CAGradientLayer() override func viewDidLoad(){ super.viewDidLoad() gradientLayer.colors = [UIColor.clear.cgColor, UIColor.white.cgColor] gradientView.layer.addSublayer(gradientLayer) } override func viewDidLayoutSubviews(){ super.viewDidLayoutSubviews() gradientLayer.frame = gradientView.bounds }
