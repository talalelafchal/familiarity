Shows error 'AppDelegate' is only available on iOS 10.0 or newer
My app target is set to ios 9.0 .As Swift 3 and xcode 8Â supports iOS 9 . Issue is when i write code it shows me error while creating appdelegate variable and it forces me to wite @availability of 10 . My code is static let APP_DELEGATE = UIApplication.shared.delegate as! AppDelegate. Its a way to create appdelegate object and its swift 3 syntax. So if I dont write like this it shows me error, If i write like this it shows me that available to ios 10 only. What to do ? My question is does this code work same as for ios 9 or any other work around is there. I dont want to write this condition. Please explain me solution as there are many places in code error is comming related to this availability and I want to avoid this.
