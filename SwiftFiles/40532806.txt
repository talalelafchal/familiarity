Swift 3 and Shell command with non regular arguments
When I calling through terminal (echo authenticate '""'; echo signal newnym; echo quit) | /usr/bin/nc localhost 9051 it works fine. But I need to use it via swift. How to write that to put in arguments? P.S. I was searching a lot of shell syntax and using shell in the swift/objc... But still can nothing to do with that... That's my shell function: func shell(_ path: String = "/bin/bash", arguments: [String] = [], waitUntilExit: Bool = false) -> String { let task = Process() task.launchPath = path task.arguments = arguments let pipe = Pipe() task.standardOutput = pipe task.launch() let data = pipe.fileHandleForReading.readDataToEndOfFile() if waitUntilExit { task.waitUntilExit() } return String(data: data, encoding: String.Encoding.utf8)! } calling self.shell(arguments: ["(echo authenticate '""'; echo signal newnym; echo quit) | /usr/bin/nc localhost 9051"]) output is No such file or directory (echo authenticate '""'; echo signal newnym; echo quit) Swift thinks ( is a directory. Why?
