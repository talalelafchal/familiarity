Swift : How to put string in \( )?
<p>I create a dictionary, and I want to use println() to print dictionary content, </p> <p>but it doesn't work, and I don't know how to solve it.. </p> <p>Please help... Thanks</p> <pre><code>var dictionary = ["name":"herny","age":20] println("name = \(dictionary["name"])"); &lt;--- this doesn't work, compile error because dictionary["name"] in \() </code></pre>
<p>You can't put things with quotes in a <code>\( )</code>, you'll need to assign it to a variable:</p> <pre><code>var dictionary = ["name": "henry", "age": "20"]; let name = dictionary["name"]; println("name = \(name)"); </code></pre>
