Failed to launch iOS stub for playground: The operation couldnâ€™t be completed. (Mach error -308 - (ipc/mig) server died).</p> <p>and when I just try to run IOS Simulator I get the following error</p> <p>Unable to boot the iOS Simulator.</p> <p>oh and this error just popped up </p> <p>An error was encountered while running (Domain = DTiPhoneSimulatorErrorDomain, Code = 2)</p> <p>I tried rebooting, I closed out and opened again, I deselected file and reselected. Just keeps happening. Anyone have a solution?</p>
<p>Your firewall is blocking the debugger, you need to allow it to connect:</p> <p><code>TCP out 127.0.0.1:63748</code></p> <p>Or allow the <code>debugserver</code> process open access (whichever you, or your firewall, prefer(s)).</p> <p>Upon enabling it, and restarting Xcode everything should work like a charm.</p> <p>Note/Update:</p> <p>If you're having trouble finding, or allowing, the <code>debugserver</code> simply try, temporarily, disabling your firewall and restart xcode. Does the playground work? Oh, and don't forget to make sure you've got the assistant view open and the output box showing.</p>
<p>Currently the Xcode 6 beta needs to reside in \Applications for the playground and simulator to work. After you move it there you need to reboot.</p>
