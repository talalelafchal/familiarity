Pass Data from View Controller MapKit
I realise there are solutions for passing data from view controllers. However, the problem I am having is I am using Map Kit and I am unsure which Pin will be clicked on it could be one of the following:  artworkPin = Artwork(title:"Wind Wand",locationName:"Majestic",discipline:"Statue", coordinate:windwandcoord) artworkPin2 = Artwork(title:"Wind Wand2",locationName:" Not Majestic",discipline:"Statue", coordinate:windwandcoord2) I want the label on the ViewTwo (second view controller) to appear as the title of the pin's "info" button that was clicked on. I currently have it setup as: var artworkPin: Artwork! override func viewDidLoad() { super.viewDidLoad() art_title.text = artworkPin.title which only loads the label as the title of artworkPin ( the first pin ). attached code if necessary: ViewTwo ViewControllerOne Thanks for your help.
However, the problem I am having is I am using Map Kit and I am unsure which Pin will be clicked on func mapView(_ mapView: MKMapView, annotationView view: MKAnnotationView, calloutAccessoryControlTapped control: UIControl) { if control == view.rightCalloutAccessoryView { if let artworkPin = view.annotation as? Artwork { performSegue(withIdentifier: "no", sender: artworkPin) } } } override func prepare(for segue: UIStoryboardSegue, sender: Any?) { if let identifier = segue.identifier { if identifier == "no" { if let artworkPin = sender as? Artwork { let ViewTwo = segue.destination as! ViewTwo ViewTwo.artworkPin = artworkPin } } } }
