Detecting screen transition (switching) globally in iOS with Swift
I was wondering if there is a way to detect screen switching globally in the app, e.g. from Application Delegate? I know there are methods like isMovingFromParentViewController() and isMovingToParentViewController(), but those can only be used locally. Any info would be helpful, thanks! Kristian
If you are going to use a global UINavigationController as the rootViewController for the UIWindow in the AppDelegate in the following way. let navigationController:UINavigationController = UINavigationController(rootViewController: ViewController()) navigationController.delegate = self window = UIWindow(frame: UIScreen.main.bounds) window?.rootViewController = navigationController window?.makeKeyAndVisible() Then the following delegate methods in UINavigationControllerDelegate will do the work in AppDelegate func navigationController(_ navigationController: UINavigationController, didShow viewController: UIViewController, animated: Bool) { } func navigationController(_ navigationController: UINavigationController, willShow viewController: UIViewController, animated: Bool) { } The above functions will help you when a new UIViewController shows up in UINavigationController. Unfortunately, there are no such methods related to UIWindow to observe those changes. Please let me know if it helps.
