Swift 3 SpriteKit main menu
I am using SpriteKit and trying to make a simple game with a main menu. I have already made the game but I am having trouble creating the main menu. Below is my code for the main menu and I want it to change to the gameScene and start my game. import SpriteKit class MenuScene: SKScene { var aButton = SKShapeNode(circleOfRadius: 50) override func didMove(to view: SKView) { aButton.fillColor = SKColor.red aButton.position = CGPoint(x: self.frame.midX, y: self.frame.midY) self.addChild(aButton) } override func touchesBegan(_ touches: Set<UITouch>, with event: UIEvent?) { let scene = GameScene(fileNamed: "aButton") scene?.scaleMode = .aspectFill view!.presentScene(scene!, transition: SKTransition.doorsOpenVertical(withDuration: 1)) } }
Try changing this line: let scene = GameScene(fileNamed: "aButton") To this: let scene = GameScene(size: self.scene.size) The first line transitions to a .SKS file named "aButton". I assume you're trying to transition once the button is touched. To do this, first give the button a name: aButton.name = "button" Then transition if it's touched. Your entire touchesBegan method should look something like this: override func touchesBegan(_ touches: Set<UITouch>, with event: UIEvent?) { let location = touches.first?.locationInNode(self) let touchedNode = self.nodeAtPoint(location) if touchedNode.name == "button" { let newScene = GameScene(size: self.scene.size) newScene.scaleMode = .aspectFill view!.presentScene(newScene, transition: SKTransition.doorsOpenVertical(withDuration: 1)) } }
