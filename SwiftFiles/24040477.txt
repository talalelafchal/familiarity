Can I include a single ObjC class when compiling Swift code?
<p>In my understanding, it will be possible to work with Obj-C classes from Swift and write test cases much more quickly, and see the results inÂ a playground project.</p> <p>Does *.playground support including just a single class, like an .m/.h pair? How does it work? Do I need to compile this class separately, or is it done automatically? </p>
<p>Unfortunately, a pure playground allows to import only Cocoa framework (for now, at least).</p> <p>If you want to import other modules, you need to create a playground file <strong>inside an existing project</strong>. That way, the underlying Swift code inside the playground can access your symbols.</p> <p>Reference: <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/24009598/does-swift-playground-support-uikit">Does swift playground support UIKit?</a> </p>
