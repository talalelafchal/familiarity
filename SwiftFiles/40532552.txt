Altering Stepper values to work as time values?
I want to have my stepper be used to add minutes to a timer. The stepper outputs + or - 1 by default, i am then using *60 to make it a minute, but this makes my timer display the total number of seconds in my timer rather than minutes. e.g. pressing it twice reads 120 in the time rather than 02:00, How would I convert this? @IBAction func restStepperValueChanged(_ sender: UIStepper) { numberOfRestLabel.text = Int(sender.value).description restCount = Int(sender.value)*60 restRemainingCountdownLabel.text = String(restCount) }
This? let seconds = restCount % 60 let minutes = (restCount / 60) % 60 let result = "\(minutes):\(seconds)" print(result)
restCount contains the number of seconds as it is set here: restCount = Int(sender.value)*60 For example: if sender.value = 1 then Int(1)*60 == 1*60 == 60 if sender.value = 2 then Int(2)*60 == 2*60 == 120 This means that this line is setting the number of seconds, not the number of minutes: restRemainingCountdownLabel.text = String(restCount) To get the time in the format of 02:00 you will need to manually construct a string using a format specifier: String(format: "%02d:%02d", minutesValue, secondsValue) An explaination: String(format:) constructs a string according to the given format string. The format string here is "%02d:%02d". %d is the format specifier for integer values and modifying it to %02d specifies two digits with an optional leading zero. Eg '01' or '12'. We use this format specifier twice and place a colon between them. and then pass in integer values for the first and second format specifier.
