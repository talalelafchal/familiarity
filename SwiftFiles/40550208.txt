using iOS CoreData with group by and selecting the last row
am struggling to achieve something with CoreData that is supposed to be easily done using SQL for example SELECT userId, max(message) from Messages group by messageId here is my attempt to do that with CoreData let fetchRequest = NSFetchRequest(entityName: "Message") let msgExpr = NSExpressionDescription() msgExpr.expression = NSExpression(format: "max:(message)") msgExpr.name = "message" msgExpr.expressionResultType = .StringAttributeType fetchRequest.propertiesToFetch = ["userId",msgExpr] fetchRequest.propertiesToGroupBy = ["userId"] fetchRequest.resultType = .DictionaryResultType do { let results = try managedObjectContext.executeFetchRequest(fetchRequest) } catch let error as NSError { print("Could not fetch \(error), \(error.userInfo)") } but apparently the aggregate function max does not work the same way in CoreData. i did not get the last message, i got the max value of the message as if it was converted into a number. I understand that CoreData isn't a relational database and its more about entities, but it there anyway i can achieve what i want? Thanks
