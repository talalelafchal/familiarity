EXC_BAD_INSTRUCTION - Fetching a Random Item from an Array
<p>I am trying to fetch a random item from an array containing 3 strings as follows :</p> <pre><code>func selectRandomImage () { var imageName : String? //Optional var arrayCount : NSNumber = animalsArray.count //Bridges to an NSNumber var x : Int = Int(arc4random())%(arrayCount.integerValue) var name : String = animalsArray[x] as String println("Name is \(name)") } </code></pre> <p>However every 5 runs or so of the code, I am getting a crash with EXC_BAD_INSTRUCTION. </p> <p>Could anyone advise on what could be wrong or how to troubleshoot ?</p> <p>Thanks !</p>
<p>arc4random doesent work well with swift, it crushes when you try to cast it to Int</p> <p>Try <code>Int(rand())</code> instead of <code>arc4random()</code></p>
