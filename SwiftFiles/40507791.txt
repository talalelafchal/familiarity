What is swift equivalent for objective c initialization allocWithZone used for UIViewController?
I was trying to find answer for translating my code from Objective c to Swift, but explanations that i found didn't resolve my problem. Here is my Objective C code: @implementation ComponentViewController // inherits UIViewController @synthesize layout // which is NSDictionary - (id)copyWithZone:(NSZone *)zone { ComponentViewController *componentViewController = [[ComponentViewController allocWithZone:zone] init]; [componentViewController setLayout:self.layout]; return componentViewController; } Since i am mistaking in Swift translation because allocWithZone is deprecated, i can't get this method correctly, and because of that i can't get right data for my dictionary LAYOUT. Here is what i've done in Swift: class ComponentViewController: TableViewController { var layout = [NSObject:AnyObject]() func copyWithZone(zone: NSZone) -> AnyObject { let componentViewController = UIViewController() as! ComponentViewController componentViewController.layout = self.layout return componentViewController as AnyObject } } Please, help me with this, i tried with something like self.dynamicType, and other code that i found googling, but can't figure this out.
