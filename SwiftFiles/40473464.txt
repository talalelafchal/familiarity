Using Google Places API with alamofire 4.0 and ios 10 swift
My project is currently built in xcode 8/swift 3 with alamofire 4.0 . My podfile is as follows: # Uncomment the next line to define a global platform for your project platform :ios, '10.0' use_frameworks! target 'WTB’ do # Comment the next line if you're not using Swift and don't want to use dynamic frameworks pod 'Alamofire', :git => 'https://github.com/Alamofire/Alamofire.git', :tag => ’4.0.0’ pod 'SwiftyJSON', git: 'https://github.com/BaiduHiDeviOS/SwiftyJSON.git', branch: 'swift3' pod 'GooglePlaces' #doesn't work when this line is added pod 'ChameleonFramework' end I get the following error in the terminal when trying to install the googlePlaces pod: - `Alamofire (from `https://github.com/Alamofire/Alamofire.git`, tag `4.0.0`)` required by `Podfile` - `Alamofire (= 4.0.0)` required by `Podfile.lock` - `Alamofire (~> 3.0)` required by `GooglePlaces (1.0.1)` Google places works with previous versions of Alamofire (3.4.0) but i cant get it working with 4.0.0+.Am i doing something wrong here? is anyone else having the same problem/ found a fix?
