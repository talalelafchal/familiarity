Swift Subclassing Subclasses of UIViewController
<p>I've created the sample <em>Master-Detail Application</em> in Xcode and I'm trying to setup a child view controller of the <code>MasterViewController</code> (say <code>UltimateViewController</code>) using:</p> <pre><code>class UltimateViewController: MasterViewController {} </code></pre> <p>This compiles, but if I open the storyboard I am unable to change (with autocomplete) the class name for the view controller to <code>UltimateViewController</code>. If I enter the name manually I am unable to wire up any existing <code>@IBOutlets</code> or <code>@IBActions</code>. Any pre-existing outlets show the warning indicator and the application crashes on launch. How can I do this type of inheritance?</p>
<p>StoryBoard sometimes does not re-index project files when you create new ones so they are not available to choose when you want to change the subclass in storyboard. For me I usually Clean the project, Close Xcode, launch XCode, build and the class is now available. </p> <p>You can also try deleting derived data for the project so it will for a total re-index of the project files. Lastly verify that the target of the file is correct. </p> <p>Lastly make sure youre using xcode 6 :)</p>
