iOS Mobile App automation from Windows PC
I found that we can use mac OSX platform along with XCode to write ui tests. It has changed to XCUI from uia. I know we can have appium server installed in mac and access it from any machine including windows and automate the iOS mobile apps but we won't be able to recognize ui elements but can trigger the tests. I see few test automation tools in the market which were able to do iOS (*.ipa) native app mobile automation on Windows platform too including deploying an app, launching an app in iphone and recognizing ui elements. Did anyone come across this on windows platform using any APIs?
