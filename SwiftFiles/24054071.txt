<h2>Problem 1:</h2> <p>Error images.count * 0.05 (images is NSArray), </p> <p>I want to play a animation</p> <h3>Code:</h3> <pre><code>func runAnimationWithCount(count: Int, name :NSString){ var images = NSMutableArray() for i in 0...count{ var imageName = NSString(format:"%02i", i) var filename = "\(name)_\(imageName).jpg" var bundle = NSBundle.mainBundle() var path = bundle.pathForResource(filename, ofType:nil) var image = UIImage(contentsOfFile: path) images.addObject(image) } tom.animationImages = images tom.animationRepeatCount = 1 tom.animationDuration = images.count * 0.05 //Error tom.startAnimating() var delay = tom.animationDuration } </code></pre> <hr> <h2>Problem 2:</h2> <p>How to convert the code (Objective-C -> Swift)</p> <pre><code> [self.tom performSelector: @selector(setAnimationImages:) withObject:nil afterDelay:delay]; </code></pre>
<p>The error is because you are trying to multiply two values of different types. You cannot do that. Convert one of the values to the type of the other.</p> <p>You do not post enough information to know for sure what the correct type to convert to is, but I'll try to guess: <code>Double(images.count) * 0.05</code></p> <p>The Objective C expression in your second question implements something that, as far as I know, does not exist and does not make sense at all in Swift. You should strive to separate Objective C and Swift code on well typed boundaries. In the Swift code that kind of thing is not needed at all. If you need to do that it must stay Objective C until you re-implement the relevant module in Swift and do it using Swift abstractions and types.</p>
