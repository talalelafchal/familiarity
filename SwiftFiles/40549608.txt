Alamofire always enter on Failure status
I am trying to make a request with Alamofire and Swift 3.0 but it is always going to the failure status. This is the code I have right now: let str = "http://url/{\"user\":\"1\",\"pass\":\"1\"}" let encodedUrl = str.addingPercentEncoding(withAllowedCharacters: .urlQueryAllowed) Alamofire.request(encodedUrl!, method: .get, parameters: nil, encoding: JSONEncoding.default, headers: nil).responseJSON { response in switch(response.result) { case .success(_): print("Success") break case .failure(_): print("Failure") break } } If I use the encodedUrl on Postman application I get the response well. It gives to me the following JSON: [ { "user": "1", "name": "peter" }, { "user": "4", "name": "andrew" }] What am I missing? Thanks in advance!
Finally, it seems that I was retrieving an extra String out of the JSON because I used an echo on my API. I could not see it because I had on Postman the option to show the response as JSON so the String was not being shown. I have changed it to HTML and then I was able to see the String. Removing the extra String let me enter on the success status of Alamofire.
