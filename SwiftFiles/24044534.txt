Interactively debug with REPL
<p>I'm trying to interactively debug with REPL. I set a breakpoint in the code, for example this code on the println line</p> <pre><code> var testVar : String = "test variable" println(testVar) </code></pre> <p>when the code blocks, I write in the console "repl" + return the repl console appears</p> <p>writing "testVar" (without quotes) I have back $R0: String = "test variable" , that is correct. However, If I write a more complicated statement, like:</p> <p>NSUserDefaults.standardUserDefaults().objectForKey("unused")</p> <p>it returns:</p> <p>Execution interrupted. Enter Swift code to recover and continue.</p> <p>Enter LLDB commands to investigate (type :help for assistance.)</p> <p>The strange thing is that I'm sure to have used this exact statement this moring and it worked (there is a post on the Apple Dev forum) What is the reason of the Execution Interrupted error?</p> <p>Thanks Fabio</p>
<p>NSUserDefaults is available in Foundation framework. </p> <p>Therefore you need to import it to REPL</p> <pre><code>import Foundation </code></pre>
