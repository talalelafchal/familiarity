iOS8 Keyboard Extension clipsToBounds
<p>I'm trying to write a custom keyboard for iOS8 and so far, minus the odd hiccup, I've not had too many issues. However, when I create a view and add it as a subview of a <code>UIButton</code> I've added to the keyboard view the newly added view is clipped at the top of the keyboard view. From what I can tell, the hierarchy is as follows:</p> <p><code>UIView</code> (popup) -> <code>UIButton</code> (actual "key") -> <code>UIInputView</code></p> <p>With this hierarchy, the top-level <code>UIView</code> is being clipped inside the <code>UIInputView</code>. Each <code>UIView</code> has had <code>clipsToBounds</code> set to <code>false</code>, and I also set the <code>UIView</code> (<code>self.view</code>) to <code>false</code> within the <code>UIInputViewController</code>, but that doesn't seem to have helped.</p> <p>It could be that this is a restriction of the extension system currently, but hopefully it's something silly I'm doing!</p>
<p>This is actually not possible. According to <a href="https://developer.apple.com/library/prerelease/ios/documentation/General/Conceptual/ExtensibilityPG/Keyboard.html#//apple_ref/doc/uid/TP40014214-CH16-SW21">the docs</a> it states "In addition, it is not possible to display key artwork above the top row, as the system keyboard does on iPhone when you tap a key in the top row.", which is a shame.</p> <p>Thanks to @Spentak for pointing that out</p>
