When to use MKMapView's MKUserTrackingMode vs Location Manager's start updating location?
I'm making an app that tracks a user's location and currently I'm doing this (once user has authorized tracking of their location)w ith the following code:  override func viewDidLoad() { super.viewDidLoad() // set map View delegate mapView.delegate = self // turn on user tracking mode to follow user if tracking == true { mapView.userTrackingMode = MKUserTrackingMode.follow } else { mapView.userTrackingMode = MKUserTrackingMode.none } } this seems to work fine for tracking the user's location and I was wondering when I would use this and when I would use locationManager.startUpdatingLocation() or stopUpdatingLocation()
