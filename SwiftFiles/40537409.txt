Binary operator '/' cannot be applied to two 'UInt32' operands
Here is my code. var frameCount = INT_MAX ... let totalSize: UInt32 = 4096 let itemSize: UInt32 = 64 frameCount = totalSize / itemSize I get "Binary operator '/' cannot be applied to two 'UInt32' operands" error message. Is it really impossible or what did I miss?
The error message is a bit misleading. INT_MAX is defined as public var INT_MAX: Int32 { get } so with var frameCount = INT_MAX frameCount is defined as a variable of type Int32. The result of the division totalSize / itemSize is a UInt32 however, and Swift does not implicitly convert types. You can fix that by changing the initial definition to var frameCount = UINT32_MAX or perhaps simpler, let the compiler infer the type: let totalSize: UInt32 = 4096 let itemSize: UInt32 = 64 let frameCount = totalSize / itemSize If you need the result as a signed integer then you have to convert it explicitly, e.g. let frameCount = Int32(totalSize / itemSize)
