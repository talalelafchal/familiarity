Not declaring a property as optional results in &quot;property not initialized at super.init()&quot; error
<p>I have written the following code for a protocol. I pass the the reference to the delegate variable and use it to call interface/protocol functions. However, if I put <code>?</code> for declaring the Protocol object, no error is generated. If I don't, it gives me an error</p> <blockquote> <p>property self.delegate is not intialized at super.init().</p> </blockquote> <p>Why is that?</p> <pre><code>protocol DownloadDataInterface { func downloadCompleted(data : NSDictionary); } class DownloadData: NSObject, NSURLConnectionDelegate, NSURLConnectionDataDelegate { var data : NSMutableData!; var delegate : DownloadDataInterface; init(keywords: String!) { super.init(); </code></pre>
<p>Because by the end of the <code>init</code> every property must have been initialized. Either at the declaration site or within the code of the <code>init</code>.</p> <p>Properties that are optional or implicitly unwrapped optional are the only exception (because, after all, that's what being optional means).</p>
