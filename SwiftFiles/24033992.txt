<p>From <a href="https://developer.apple.com/library/prerelease/ios/documentation/Swift/Conceptual/BuildingCocoaApps/BuildingCocoaApps.pdf" rel="nofollow">Docs</a>,</p> <blockquote> <p>The Swift compiler does not include a preprocessor. Instead, it takes advantage of compile-time attributes, build configurations, and language features to accomplish the same functionality. For this reason, preprocessor directives are not imported in Swift.</p> </blockquote> <p><strong><em>So how could be use this great feature(#Pragma mark -) in Swift</em></strong> ?</p>
