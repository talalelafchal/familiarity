How to prevent from notifying user on the screen about new change in CloudKit?
This is how I prepare subscription: class func saveSubscriptions() { let options: CKSubscriptionOptions = [.firesOnRecordCreation, .firesOnRecordUpdate, .firesOnRecordDeletion] let serviceSubscription = CKSubscription(recordType: "Service", predicate: NSPredicate(value: true), options: options) let notificationInfo = CKNotificationInfo() notificationInfo.alertLocalizationKey = "s" notificationInfo.shouldBadge = false notificationInfo.shouldSendContentAvailable = false serviceSubscription.notificationInfo = notificationInfo CloudContainer.publicCloudDatabase.save(serviceSubscription) { _, _ in } } and notification appears on the screen permanently. I really do not wanna this here. Is there a way to deliver the notification if app is active but to not display anything while the app is not running or is in the foreground mode?
You need to setup the notification info properly. Don't set alertLocalizationKey. shouldSendContentAvailable should be set to true.
Try this code, this will not show banner for notification let notificationInfo = CKNotificationInfo() notificationInfo.shouldBadge = false notificationInfo.shouldSendContentAvailable = true subscription.notificationInfo = notificationInfo
