Detect existence of camera in iPhone app?
<p>I'm writing an iOS app, and I need to be able to detect if the device has a camera. Previously, I would check if the device is an iPhone or not, since only the iPhone has a camera - but with the launch of the iPod Touch 4 this is no longer a viable option. The app functions without a camera, but the presence of a camera adds functionality.</p> <p>So, can anyone provide me with code that returns whether there is a camera or not?</p>
<p>You can use <code>+isSourceTypeAvailable:</code> method in UIImagePickerController:</p> <pre><code>if ([UIImagePickerController isSourceTypeAvailable: UIImagePickerControllerSourceTypeCamera]) // Has camera </code></pre>
<p>Yes, there is an API provided to do just that:</p> <pre><code>BOOL isCamera = [UIImagePickerController isSourceTypeAvailable:UIImagePickerControllerSourceTypeCamera]; </code></pre>
<p>If you are using the AV Foundation classes instead of UIImagePickerController you can do:</p> <pre><code>BOOL hasCamera = ([[AVCaptureDevice devices] count] &gt; 0); </code></pre> <p>If you are using UIImagePickerController it probably isn't worth it, since you'd have to add AVFoundation.framework to your project.</p>
<p>If you need to know whether the device specifically has a front or rear camera, use this: </p> <pre><code>isCameraAvailable = [UIImagePickerController isCameraDeviceAvailable:UIImagePickerControllerCameraDeviceFront]; </code></pre>
<p><strong>Swift 2:</strong></p> <pre><code>if UIImagePickerController.isSourceTypeAvailable(.Camera){ //Your code goes here //For example you can print available media types: print(UIImagePickerController.availableMediaTypesForSourceType(.Camera)) } </code></pre>
<p>To check of camera is available (Swift)</p> <pre><code>if(!UIImagePickerController.isSourceTypeAvailable(UIImagePickerControllerSourceType.Camera)) </code></pre>
