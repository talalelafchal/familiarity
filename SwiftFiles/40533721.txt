UITextFiled with Secure Text Entry on iOS10 will crash when pasting in long string
This seems to only affect apps running on iOS 10. Both on devices and in the simulator. There is no exception thrown, but the CPU load jumps to 100% and memory runs up until the app gets killed. Still trying to isolate the issue and would appreciate any help.
This appears to be a genuine iOS10 bug, but it's only caused when the text field has it's 'adjust to fit' property enabled. So far the only fix I found is to disable it. passwordTextField.adjustsFontSizeToFitWidth = false
