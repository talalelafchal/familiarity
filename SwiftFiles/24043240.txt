Is it possible to import third-party Objective-C code into a Swift playground?
<p>As suggested <a href="https://developer.apple.com/library/prerelease/ios/documentation/swift/conceptual/buildingcocoaapps/MixandMatch.html#//apple_ref/doc/uid/TP40014216-CH10-XID_75" rel="nofollow">here</a> I've been able to import my existing Objective-C code into a .swift file via the bridging header. As of yet I've been unable to do something similar with a swift playground - it does not seem to recognise the header in the same way that a swift file does.</p> <p>Interestingly, and possibly suggestive of a negative to my question is that playgrounds do not appear to share the concept of target membership like .swift/.m</p> <p>Anyone had any success with this or perhaps a different mechanism?</p>

Then create a playground <em>in that project</em> and the playground should be able to work with any of the ObjC classes in the project.</p>
