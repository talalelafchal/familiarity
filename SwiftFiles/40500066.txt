concatenate in swift3.0: Binary operator '+' cannot be applied to operands of type '[]' and '[]?'
get the error in Swift3.0: Binary operator '+' cannot be applied to operands of type '[FutureTrainee]' and '[FutureTrainee]?' Code: let newTrainees = data?["data"].arrayValue.map({ (json) in return FutureTrainee(data: json) }) let trainees = self.futureTraineeCollection.futureTrainees + newTrainees
Just as the error suggests, you can't use + to add [FutureTrainee] (a.k.a Array<FutureTrainee>) and [FutureTrainee]? (a.k.a. Optional<Array<FutureTrainee>>. newTrainees has type [FutureTrainee]? because you used optional chaining to subscript data with "data". This code: let newTrainees = data?["data"].arrayValue.map({ (json) in return FutureTrainee(data: json) }) is like: var newTrainees: [FutureTrainee]? if let data = data { newTrainees = data["data"].arrayValue.map({ (json) in return FutureTrainee(data: json) }) else { newTrainees = nil } You need to make sure you only append the newTrainees if it's not nil, like so: var trainees = self.futureTraineeCollection if let newTrainees = data?["data"].arrayValue.map{ FutureTrainee(data: $0) } { // If that expression is not nil, the result is bound to "newTrainees" trainees += newTrainees }
