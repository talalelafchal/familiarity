Xcode6 beta SourceKitService error
<p>I'm running lastest Mavenricks with Xcode 5.1.1</p> <p>I've downloaded Xcode 6 beta from apple and this message shows up constantly. Thus, I can barely write any code because code completion disabled.</p> <p>Does anyone know how to fix this ?</p> <p><img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/yzxDx.png" alt="enter image description here"></p>
<p>Is your project named <code>Swift</code>? With seeing that message, build would be failed too with message: <code>&lt;unknown&gt;:0: error: module name "Swift" is reserved for the standard library</code>. Try using another project name such as <code>SwiftTest</code>. It would work.</p> <p>(Duplicated: <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/24006206/sourcekitservice-terminated/24009979#24009979">SourceKitService Terminated</a>)</p>
<p>Try For it</p> <p>**</p> <blockquote> <p>There is a bug in the Swift compiler / indexer. Some line or lines in your code is giving it difficulty. You will have to edit your code with some other text editor to comment out the offending line(s) before you will be able to open that project with Xcode. If you have no clue what the problem is, comment out all your code. Once you have the project open, you can start bringing back code little by little until the rise in CPU activity tells you that you've found the problem.</p> </blockquote> <p>**</p>
