Create a custom tableViewCell which will contain textView and imageView according to your requirements. And go through the Link And for the different type of datatypes you have to create a dictionary(or array of dictionary) of key value pair. Please visit the Link If you have two types of feeds one with image and another without it, then you may create two different custom cells and use them accordingly. Another option is to make imageView's height as zero by creating an outlet of constraint.But I won't support this, this should be used sparingly. It's better to create an array which contains dictionary. where you dont have image just set value of "image" to empty string.  var dict1:[String:String] = ["text":"my text....","image":"imagename.png"] var dict2: [String:String] = ["text": "my text...", "image":""] var myDictArray = [[String:String]]() myDictArray.append(dict1) myDictArray.append(dict2) while placing them in uitableviewcell just check the dictionary value for the key "image". If it's not empty then load the first custom cell(with imageView and textView) else load the second custom cell(without imageView)
Add a UILabel and UIImageView as you normally would in a cell. (I would suggest a UILabel instead of a UITextView if you are only displaying the text, correct me if I'm wrong). Setup your constraints for the label to have a leading, top and trailing. Set its numberOfLines to be 0 and content mode to word wrap. Now for your UIImageView, add a top to the UILabel. Leading, trailing and bottom to superView. Now also setup a height constraint for your UIImageView that will be a minimum value. Create an IBOutlet for this constraint inside your cell. Now, in your UIViewController set the tableView.estimatedRowHeight property and also tableView.rowHeight = UITableViewAutomaticDimensions. Soo now, inside your cellForRowAtIndexPath, whenever your cell contains an image set the height constraint to be the minimum value otherwise set it to 0. Edit: -(UITableViewCell *)tableView:(UITableView *)tableView cellForRowAtIndexPath:(NSIndexPath *)indexPath{ CustomCell *cell = [tableView dequeueReusableCellWithReuseIdentifier:@"cell"]; //select your model from the array corresponding to your indexPath.row CustomModel *model = array[indexPath.row] // I am assuming you are fetching image from server NSString *imageUrlString = model.imageUrl //check your model if it contains an image if(imageUrlString){ cell.imageHeightConstraint = 250.0f; }else{ cell.imageHeightConstraint = 0.0f; } }
